0,"Couldn't decide on a place originally and somehow just picked this place as I was still wanting sushi in the area. Came here and looked at the menu - it was rather extensive, which I enjoyed. They even offered my sake toro (salmon belly). Naturally, I ordered some. As well as regular sake (salmon). I also got the Katana Combo sampler as I was really hungry. I also ended up ordering the salmon torched roll because if you haven't guessed, I love salmon so much plus avocado. They did offer cocktails and a wine menu, but I was not feeling it in me to drink that night, so water it is.Our waitress was very nice and explained the menu items we ordered off the menu and service was quick. The food came out relatively quickly and I finished the entire sampler platter, as well as all the other dishes I ordered. The plum sauce that came with the sampler platter was sweet with the right amount of kick. It was great with the crispy dumplings and calamari. When my sake toro came out, it was so buttery soft and fatty, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. The specialty roll, salmon torched roll, was actually pretty good as well. The marriage of the salmon and the avocado just worked well, and it wasn't just regular salmon. It was salmon belly on top. Which made it delightfully better in my opinion. Overall I had a wonderfully surprising experience here. I wasn't expecting the restaurant to serve sake toro. There's only one sushi place that I know of back in Houston that serves it when you ask for it, but otherwise, it's not common for me to see it on smack dab on the menu. I was glad that I ended up coming here and got my salmon belly fix. I highly recommend this place. Service was great, ambience was nice, and the food was really good!"
1,"I just noticed Little Katana recently as I was driving through the area and I'm very happy I decided to try it out. I'm not a sushi eater so I can't speak to that, though I've heard good things, but their Sizzlin' Dumpling appetizer was awesome! As a non-fish eater, I had the bulgogi and it was good. I wish it came with some sides but it was good nonetheless. My bf had the bento full of sashimi and he seemed to really enjoy it. We both agreed we'd love to come back in the future!Pricing seemed about right - maybe a tiny bit pricey for certain items but pretty good! The staff was friendly and by 6:30/7PM the place really filled up."
2,Let me start with -- wow. This is amazing. The quality of the fish was wonderful. Every roll had a great texture with the combination of what they put in there and the taste. For example the paradise roll is so great. I love how buttery the salmon is and then paired with an mango for that sweetness and avocado for they creamy feeling. I just have to say this may be my new fave sushi place.
3,"Best sushi in town and service was so amazing. Special thanks to my hostess, she made us feel so comfortable and recommended the traditional sake and sushis. Katana 101 roll, sashimi sampler and spicy edamame- donot miss them. We ordered Ahi tuna tower, sashimi sampler, traditional Â hot sake, katana 101 roll, spicy edamame and Tonkutsa ramen. Ramen was okayish but the sushis were to die for, dine in experience is excellent."
4,"Really impressed by the quality of the sushi here. We go out for sushi quite a bit and it's hard finding amazing sushi at a reasonable price. This place nails it. Even on a Sunday night, the place was packed. We saw that they have some awesome weekday lunch specials. Will be back for those and more"
5,This was $18. This is a joke. Tasted fishy and not fresh. A total rip off. Horrible value.
6,"I think it's about time that I do a review for my favourite neighbourhood restaurant. Been here many, many times and it never disappoints. I do have my signature dishes after trying a few so I'll try to cover everything I've had here.Been here before and during Covid and they are managing it very well. Masks on entry, temperature check, hand sanitizer and social distancing. So again the below list was ordered over several visits - not all at once!Avocado Egg Roll ($8) - Delicious starter and fried treat. Love the sweet chili sauce too.Shrimp & Veggie Tempura ($10) - 3 pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of veggies. Decent tempura but not really a fan of the sauce.Spicy Pork ($18) - I always ask for extra spicy and it is pretty good. Large quantity and tasty spicy sauce.Orange Ginger Salmon ($22) - The hubs fave. Very healthy option and the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Sauteed Mushrooms are super delish. The orange ginger glaze is pretty yum too.Sashimi Appetizer ($12) - I love sashimi so always get this if we're dining in.LA Kalbi ($22) - This is my favourite. I always ask to make it spicy so they usually put chili flakes on it and extra of their special soy sauce.Philadelphia Roll ($7) - Usual to go order and it's very good.Spicy Chicken ($18) - Delicious Korean Spicy Chicken. Extra spicy of course and good quantity. You can pick two sides and always go with wasabi mashed potatoes and either sauteed mushrooms or grilled asparagus.Salmon Teriyaki Bento ($13) - Comes with Miso Soup, House Salad, 2 pieces of Shrimp and 2 pieces of Veg Tempura, 4 pieces of California roll and Wasabi Mashed Potatoes - The salmon was done well. Some places they make it too dry but this was just right. Extra teriyaki sauce too.Sizzling Dumplings ($10) - Crispy and yum, the sauce is great too.Ginger Vanilla Creme Brulee ($5) - This was delicious, usually don't have room for dessert but the one time I did tried this and it was really good.Drinks - Hot sake everytime.Quantity - Good quantity and very filling.Ambience - It's casual but nice and they are doing social distancing and maintaining everything really well.Service - Excellent - everytime it has been good. Servers are all really lovely and helpful - have never had a bad experience here.Spice - 2/5, Yea it's not spicy, but it is very flavourful.Taste - Really great, especially since over time I have found my go-tos and they never disappoint.Really lovely neighbourhood joint, casual feel and awesome service. My fave dishes are the Sashimi, LA Kalbi, Spicy Chicken, Orange Ginger Salmon, Philly Roll and Yakisoba Noodles. They have a good happy hour from 5-6.30PM Mon-Fri. Happy to support this awesome place :)"
7,"We didn't know this place was here, but so glad we found it! Food was really good and testy. I totally recommend this place!"
8,"I was there last weekend I order the avocado egg rolls , fried dumplings, tempura noodles soup, the temperatura and the egg rolls were horrible they weren't crispy at all. I been to the one in uptown and everything there is fantastic,The service was great, the sushi was great they need more work in the fried items"
9,"I cannot believe I haven't taken advantage of Little Katana's lunch specials before! They have select specialty rolls you can choose two from for $10, and they are decent-size pieces and very flavorful and fresh. I noticed they have lunch-portion ramen and noodles as well! I called in my order of the spicy California and shrimp tempura around 11:15 and picked it up at 11:30. The restaurant was very clean and they have plexiglass up at the cash register. Looking at their dinner menu left me drooling, next time I come back I want to try their dinner or Korean entrees like kalbi or hot stone bowls. Many people have told me they've frequented this location for date nights, so it's next on my list!"
10,"I love sushi, and Little Katana has been on my radar for awhile now. Decided to try takeout and was pleasantly surprised. I had the rainbow, Philadelphia, and spicy tuna rolls, along with salmon belly sashimi. Also threw in the yakisoba noodles for kicks. The salmon belly was amazing! This place is reasonably priced and about what you'd expect for good sushi. Would I go back? Definitely."
11,"It's taken a few tries to decide, but I definitely like Little Katana and enjoy it every time I have it. Their mochi ice cream is really a highlight - mango in particular. The strawberry flavor is also really good too and the only one I didn't enjoy as much was the green tea flavor. The mochi come three per order and they will let you mix and match if you want to try different flavors. I don't know how they manage to get such soft, delightful mochi but it really is some of the best I've ever had. Sometimes we order just mochi because it's that good! As far as their other food is concerned, it's all generally good, but if it's during dinnertime, a little pricy. Their lunch bentos are a great deal because they come with miso soup, salad, a large portion of tempura, and four pieces of california roll (in addition to your main entree). My husband tried the sushi/sashimi the other day and the fish was very fresh. I liked the beef tenderloin (which they will prepare to your liking). My mom didn't enjoy the chicken teriyaki as much as from other places, but liked her meal as a whole. Their rolls tend to be very good and we especially like their salmon avocado roll and louisiana roll. I look forward to dining in sometime and trying their happy hour!"
12,One of my favorite lunch spots when I'm visiting clients in Las Colinas. The service is exceptional and the quality of the sushi is excellent. I prefer to sit at the sushi bar and usually enjoy the super fresh and flavorful salmon sashimi. I've been here at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed.
13,This place was a nice quiet vibe and has a full bar with lots of tables to sit at. The crab meat dynamite roll was absolutely delicious and the service was wonderful as well.
14,"Delicious healthy and tasty bento box lunches with a very interesting flavorful citrusy vinaigrette ginger salad dressing! I don't mind eating salad from here because of the traditional Japanese salad dressing I enjoyed the chicken teriyaki bento box that comes with a large side of tempura fried vegetables and shrimp, California roll,Delicious seaweed miso soup, rice or wasabi mashed potatoes, and salad"
15,"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. They have a temperature check machine at the door that's a little wonky but I'm all for added safety precautions! I started with a hot green tea, nothing special flavor wise but great for a chilly day. The teriyaki salmon bento box was delicious, I chose the wasabi mashed potatoes, and very filling. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu."
16,"This sushi was very good! They were open late so we were able to get something to eat & have drinks. we got the combination fried rice, 2 signature rolls & a white wine."
17,I always have happy feelings at Little Katana. It is definitely not the typical sushi place that has a piano and westernized interior design but with bomb Asian fusion/Japanese cuisine. I take people here with many different occasions from business lunch to date night or family dining. Your guest(s) won't be disappointed. The service is ALWAYS top of the notch. I was always pleased with their prompt and professional service.
18,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE anyone who are craving for some authentic sushi this is place to go. On my birthday i had a really great time and wonderful experience dining in Little Kitana. We ordered shrimp & veggie tempura in appetizers and tiger rolls & Kitana rolls in the main course along with hot sake. Food was absolutely amazing. And we received a mango cheese cake as dessert with a candle on top with the stewardess singing happy birthday to me was a huge surprise. This mango cheese cake was the best I ever tasted. Staff was extremely friendly. Service was fast. Restaurant was super neat. Music was also decent and can have a nice conversation. Overall experience was great. We made Little Kitana our go to for any sushi rolls craving. Terrific food!!!
19,I am new to the area and have been hearing this is one of the next sushi spots in the area. Â The service was attentive and friendly. Â The dining area was well spaced. The nigiri sushi in particular was of excellent quality. I will definitely be back.
20,It was good. The spicy chkn wasnt spicy at all though. The sushi is great. Fresh ingredients & staff is friendly
21,"This place is delicious. You can taste quality in the food. We ordered Hot Stone Bowl which is a must get if you visit Little Katana.. they ask you what ingredients you dont want added. They will also mix the egg once they bring the hot stone bowl to your table! The rice stayed nice and hot throughout the entire dinner! We also ordered LA Kalbi and it was super rich in flavor. Of course, we had to sushi and we went with their Katana Roll, which has crab meat, shrimp, avocado, spicy mayo and katana sauce(not sure). You can really taste the quality in the food! You won't be disappointed. We made this our monthly dinner spot."
22,"I visited this place for a weekday lunch with office colleagues.The place specializes in Japanese Cuisine and located in Las Colinas, Irving. Here is my perspective about the place.Food (4/5) - I tried two of their dishes which were:1. Veggie and Tofu Bentos - This was a full meal which contained in house salad, miso soup, 4 pcs of veggie tempura (onion and cucumber), Avocado Roll, Mashed Potatoes and Tofus glazed in Teriyaki way. I loved the Tofus and Veggie Tempuras. Avocado Roll and Soup tasted average. The presentation of the dish was amazing.2. Osaka Miso - It was a type of Ramen and had SoyBeans. It tasted a bit bland to me and so I added chilli sauce into it. After that, it tasted good.Service (4.5/5) - The staff was very courteous and welcomed us with the lovely smiles. The service was also pretty quick. Ambience (4.5/5) - The place gives you good vibes and you feel like you have come to a very fancy place even though the prices are very reasonable. The overall experience was good and I would recommend visiting this place for sure."
23,"I'm literally always so hesitant to try new sushi places because of the reasons I'll share below. I moved from Houston for a job in Irving so I'm still trying to find my favorite spots for all types of food. I already know fusion places don't have the best quality food and I really should've just stuck with that inkling. SO; if you didn't know that already, there's FOODIE TIP #1 - Fusion restaurants are usually NEVER good. The sushi roll options were all california roll base then whatever else added to make different combinations. We got an order of salmon belly and it was $16 for 5 sashimi pieces. Now I know salmon belly is pricier than regular salmon but the quality was NOT there. I've paid that same amount for JUST SALMON at better quality. The rice that the rolls were made with was either not the right rice or cooked wrong. It wasn't sticky & every single piece broke apart so I couldn't even pick it up with my chopstick. The calamari looked & tasted like it could've been from Wendy's. The color/taste of the batter and the sweet n sour sauce it comes with - Wendy's chicken nuggets with sweet n sour sauce ! I wish I was making this up. I don't even know where to start for the hot stone bowl. The meat vs rice ratio was like 3:1. Of course whoooo complains about getting too much meat !? When every bite was 3 chunks meat w 3 grains of rice !! Overall experience was 3 stars. If I was giving starts for different aspects it would be - Service - 4 StarsFood - 1 StarLocation/Parking - 3 StarsAmbiance/Culture - 3 StarsI wouldn't recommend this place knowing there's better quality of everything I ordered there, elsewhere. Even if it was walking distance from work, I'd make the drive to go somewhere else. The price point and the quality didn't match & it was quite disappointing I paid so much for what I got. You live & you learn !!"
24,"The absolute worse Las Colinas lunch experience of my life!!!! The manager clearly shouldn't be managing anything as he was running around like a lost child! I came in and the place was packed, it took over 20 minutes to get anyone's attention I asked for a drink menu he says they don't serve cocktails during lunch....come again(wtf) I left the service was horrendous I would rate zero stars if I could!!!!"
25,"Came here with a friend, the energy and ambience is exhilarating. The service was very polite and attentive. The Sushi rolls and sashimi was excellent, very fresh. But baby bring your wallet, cause this place will break the bank!"
26,"The food here was fantastic. I am a sushi lover and it's hard to find good fresh fish around the area. (I'm picky when it comes to raw fish) texture and flavor. They do not disappoint!! I ordered the salmon belly, fatty tuna, regular salmon and tuna sushi. As well as Katana 101 Roll and a hand roll. I sat at the sushi bar and the man preparing it all was so nice and super helpful! Will definitely be back"
27,"Came here on a business trip since it was close to our hotel and it was a delicious dinner. We didn't come in super hungry but needed to eat something before we called it a night. The food was delicious! You know you can judge a sushi place by the sushi rice. We ordered a no problem roll and a scallop dynamite. No problem roll was really good with deep fried soft shelled crab which added crunchy texture to the roll. The crab was fried to perfect crispiness but you could still taste the firm meat inside it. Scallop dynamite was very interesting - there were about 6 pieces of California rolls topped with imitation crab meat and baked scallop tossed in spicy mayo and drizzled with eel sauce. We thought the crab meat and scallop mixture had way too much mayo which made it too creamy. The baked scallop was warm so it made the California rolls a bit soggy, the rice fell off easily when we grabbed the rolls. Service: Very nice, fast, and attentive.Pricing: It's a bit pricey. Each specialty roll is about $15-17. The no problem has about 6 pieces. It's pretty pricey but considering the food has high quality I think it's acceptable. Parking: It's located in a shopping center so there're plenty of parking spots. Overall it was a good experience."
28,"Sushi is very good. The yellow tail belly and salmon belly were fresh, and the spicy chopped scallop was one of the best I've had. The spider roll was also tasty, and I'm glad it didn't have lettuce fillers like other places put in it. The crunchy tempura roll was decent, but the fried roll (king roll?) would have been better without cream cheese. However, some people like that so â. Service was lacking though, and the food came out slowly. However, the quality is enough to bring me back."
29,"Wow ....just wow! Â This place is A-mazing!!!Super nice staff, clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, but the food is A+++. You haven't lived until you've tried their Brussels Sprouts appetizers and their Dynamite sushi rolls are seriously the BEST that I've ever had. This little place is a BIG TIME GEM!! Will be returning again, and again, and again."
30,"I went here with a friend yesterday for happy hour. It had been a long week and we needed to end it at a good happy hour. She told me that she found this happy hour that is great and close to her home. After arriving, I wasn't sure what to expect because it looks pretty simple on the outside. After entering, I was impressed. The decor was really nice and the mood was very relaxing. I think this would be a great date spot. My friend suggested I start out with the mule. She said it was delicious and it was absolutely yummy. We got the jalapeÃ±o popper, crispy calamari, and the shrimp and vegetable tempura. The food was delicious. Overall I was highly impressed with the food and drinks and will definitely be back for their happy hour. Everything was great and price was affordable"
31,This was AWFUL!!! OMG!!!Tasteless Rice the worst I've ever had seriously how in the world do they get away charging me for this.Sushi was not good... Below averageMiso soup was good but just averageAvocado eggroll was tasteless and just a huge miss. I expected amazing flavor pops.Disappointed
32,"Love it!! The flavors on the sushi rolls are great. I really can't complain. The ramen was good and fresh. The rolls we got had tons of flavor and a good amount of fish. We have tried the rainbow roll, charming roll, spicy California and regular, the spider roll, and mama roll. My favorites were the mama and charming. Well be back for sure. I was too hungry to take pictures, but trust it was good. Also I will say it is so much better than blue fish, by a lot. Don't go there go here!"
33,Solid Japanese place in Las Colinas! I've come several times and its always good. Sushi is decent portion and tastes fresh.
34,"Oh ramen. You either love it, or you love it. And in my case, I really do love it. I cam here with a few coworkers for the intention of getting ramen only.This place has a nice interior.The service, while really friendly, was a bit slow. After we got our waters, it took about 10-15 minutes before they came back to take our food order. It was a tad busy (maybe half the restaurant was full), but lots of wait staff. So I dunno._ Tonkatsu $10The broth was good and I really appreciated that it wasn't overly salty, which tends to be the problem with most ramen places. Even though it was pork bone broth, it wasn't super heavy either. I appreciated that quite a bit.The noodles were also good, but not al dente. It didn't have that BITE that I love. But still good. The ramen had lots of seaweed, few pieces of bamboo shoots, which I love and the chashu was tasty. A few bits of the chashu was slightly overcooked, but I think that attributes to the fact that they GRILL the pork belly. OMG. The tiny hints of char was actually really nice. I really enjoyed that surprisingly. The lines on the chashu made it look that much more appealing. Also, the chashu is a bit on the smaller side, but overall the flavor was good.The biggest downfall of this dish though was the egg. It was hardboiled. WHY :( The gooey soft-boiled egg yolk is always my favorite part of the ramen, so it was disappointing when they brought the bowls out and I saw the yolk was hardboiled. I'd recommend they change this. Otherwise, if you're craving ramen, this will at least hit the spot."
35,"Good, local sushi, can't go wrong. I recommend to anyone from the las colinas area, not sure if it's a place to drive and eat at -- haven't ever ate inside the restaurant so if the ambience inside is also worth it, I will update this review!"
36,"Little Katana is pretty good, but also on the expensive side. The most expensive? Nah, but still higher than a lot of the competition. Mostly that applies to the dinner menu and entrÃ©es. Luckily they have a lunch menu that is varied and much more reasonable, ranging $1-3 higher than similar restaurants. I came by last month for an early lunch with some fellow yelpers on a Friday. The place has nice dÃ©cor, though the lighting is quite dim. This is more of a social setting than an ideal place for a business lunch. It was quite busy too. Since the place was bustling at times, it wasn't always easy to locate our server. I was glad to see the wide selection, but was torn between a bento and sushi as getting both was higher than I like to spend on a lunch. I settled on the sushi lunch bento for $14. It comes with tuna, salmon, yellowtail and shrimp and is served with your choice of rice or wasabi mash, California roll, tempura, soup and salad.I was genuinely pleased at the portions, they were a good amount for all the different dishes and a better match for the price than I was expecting. Everything was nicely presented. Most of us got bento boxes, though I was very distracted by the heavenly smell of the hot stone bowl at the table.The meal as a whole tasted very good! There were a couple of misses, the yellowtail tasted strange and the shrimp was really hard and in my opinion, inedible. Neither of those were enjoyable and I wouldn't order again.However, there were way more hits. The miso was decent, the salad was fresh, and the tempura and California roll were both on par. Salmon is one of my favorites and this was really good. Tuna is not my favorite because it's difficult to find high quality tuna that isn't sinewy around here, Little Katana definitely beats the competition on tuna, it was well above average!Though satisfied with my meal I was a little conflicted about my opinion of the sushi and value. I decided to order through UberEats the following week. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento which was a very reasonable $11. It was a decent lunch with a similar portion as the dine in option. Everything was pretty good. My only confusion was the dish was actually grilled chicken with some sauce sprinkled on it, not actually cooked and tossed in the teriyaki. Not a big deal, just not what I was expecting.There is still plenty on the menu to try and I do plan on trying more sushi and several more dishes. The food averages out to four stars, you'll have a good meal overall. The value for me is what brings it down a star. When you have higher prices, I feel you have to do something different than other places, or have the highest quality to justify it. I didn't particularly feel that was the case, but it's a strong 3 and I'll be back again."
37,It was okay. Sushi was good. Ordered the teriyaki chicken to go and I was not a fan of the chicken. I'm a quality meat person and definitely felt like it was poor quality and under cooked
38,Smoked salmon sushi and the katana 101 roll is a must try! Staff was friendly and attentive. Gladly return and recommend
39,"4.5 stars to be exact. PSA: Wednesdays are 1/2 price wine bottles night. The servers are absolutely wonderful! I was hesitant coming into the place because of the appearance outside (looks very plain) but read some of the reviews and decided to try it out. Sooo happy we came in. The atmosphere was nice casual. It was the perfect place for dinner - low key, casual, dim lighting, and simple modern decor. I'd say it's good for a date night and catching up with friends. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio, crab tower, crab sushi, and a hot stone rice bowl with a combination of beef, chicken, and shrimp. The food came out promptly, looked great and tasted good. The only minor criticism I have is the meat in the stone bowl was a tad over cooked, but that would not keep me from coming back. Service was exceptional."
40,"Let's say you had to pick up your friend from DFW airport. Â It's past 9pm and they're hungry! Take them to Little Katana! They'll love it and so will you. Minutes from the airport, Â this is one of the few restaurants in the area with convenient hours. They also have Â great service, Â and most importantly, Â great food. I ordered the Sunny roll, Â for obvious reasons. Â It was delicious! I forgot what my friend ordered but she was also impressed by her roll. I also ordered the chicken teriyaki meal for my daughter. It was fairly portioned. Â On top of all that, Â the prices were fair. I wouldn't mind coming back!"
41,"My family and I came here for dinner one night and really enjoyed! We shared a few appetizers, the calamari (delicious and crispy. Had some fried jalapeÃ±os in there as well) and the jalapeÃ±o popper appetizer (also delicious with raw tuna and crab on top and jalapeÃ±o on bottom!). We all really enjoyed these. For entree most of my family for bento boxes. You need to ask for the dinner menu bento boxes if you want to order them, since the dinner bento menu is separate from the regular dinner menu. My boyfriend and I shared three sushi rolls, a classic spicy tuna, the spicy crawfish, and the sunny roll. All were delicious!! And really hit the spot of my sushi craving. All in all amazing food and my mom even enjoyed it! And she's incredibly picky.As for the service, it was decent but a little lacking. Initially we had to wait a bit for them to get utensils/dinner napkin for us when the appetizers were already served. Secondly, when my mom got her bento box, it was supposed to come with shrimp and vegetable tempura but they skipped it on her plate, leaving just lettuce. When we told our waitress, she agreed. Five minutes later another waitress comes and said it didn't come with the ""nigiri"" bento but my dad got that bento, not her. We corrected their mistake but it just took an altercation and misunderstanding to get there."
42,The lunch bento box is such a great deal! The bulgogi here is my absolute favorite!!! Sushi is decent as well.
43,Food wasn't up to standard. Â Salty chicken. Â Sushi fell apart. Â Lobster was chewy and sub standard. Â Edamame was unsalted. Â 3 stars is generous.
44,"Suzuki San is indeed here! I heard this, but I was not going to believe it until I saw it. I was heartbroken when Hanasho closed, and feared I would never find its equal. Fear abated. Little Katana was great. I am basing this review on a sushi only, sit at the sushi bar experience. While the restaurant has plenty of seating, we wanted to sit at the sushi bar and catch up with Suzuki San. First, I was delighted to see a Happy Hour, that includes food and drink specials. HH is M-F 3PM to 7PM. HH Menu: yelp.com/biz_photos/littâ¦ What did we have? We started with an edamame (HH price $2), a crispy calamari (HH $5), a and large hot sake (HH $4). Calamari was very good. We moved onto a tuna sushi maguro ($6), a salmon sushi sake ($6), a scallop hotategai sushi ($6), a yellow tail roll ($7), an eel roll ($8), and a spider roll ($11). Everything was fantastic, with one exception. We thought the crab in the spider roll was a little over cooked (over fried). Not a deal breaker. Other than that, everything was perfect. The salmon was particularly good. We passed on the desert options, well desert in the conventional sense. As we finished up, Suzuki San presented us with an uni sushi. This was always our ""desert"" at Hanasho, and it was super cool that Suzuki San remembered. Thank you! Service was impeccable throughout the meal. Bottom line: Little Katana is now OUR new favorite place for sushi, but I can't wait to try other items on the menu."
45,Absolutely loved this place. I ordered the edamame and I believe it's called the dragonfly roll which was massive enough for 2 ppl and just overall delicious. My favorite sushi place in the Irving and las Colinas area. They have great customer service and great warm Sake. Def returning !
46,"Came into town from California for work & this place was highly recommended. Place was a little crowded, so chose to order and take back to the hotel. Wait was a bit long, but owner was very apologetic & included a couple of free miso soups., because of the wait. Food was delicious. Based on first time experience, placed look great, food was great, and I would come back any day of the week...if I lived in the area. lol"
47,"I Â work in the area so I decided to take some quests here for dinner and thought that it was OK. We had a variety of different items including a couple of appetizers and a variety of dinner entrees. Â For our appetizers, we had the fried calamari and the jalapeno poppers. I was a little surprised that the calamari was smaller than I expected and that it also had jalapenos included in the fried items on the plate. Â I do not think of pairing calamari and jalapenos, but the dipping sauce was good. Â The jalapeno poppers are filled with the imitation crab filling from a standard California roll. Â I thought that this was a nice twist on a traditional popper and this was probably my favorite item.I got the hot stone bowl which is a really cool dish served with a nice touch of at table service. Â The bowl is super hot and keeps your food extremely warm throughout your meal. Â This is the dish that did not make this a 4 star for me. Â I felt that the flavors were lost in this dish and that i expected more from the combination of shrimp and veggies.The service was also OK but we had to ask for things like more water multiple times. Â I will have to try this place for lunch and see what I think, maybe it is a better value for your dollar during the lunch hour."
48,"Overrated and overpriced. I really wanted to like this place but you can take a quick trip to Carrollton for better and tastier sushi. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed."
49,"Good sushi and maki/sushi rolls selections and other items such as hot rice bowls and other Asian fare. Fish could be little fresh/delicate, specially Tuna.Service is very friendly and prompt!"
50,"My friend and I were craving sushi during the night and conveniently this place was open! They take your temperature as soon as you go in the restaurant which I appreciate. I got the Spider Roll and the dumplings. I could tell that the quality of the spider roll was pretty good. Although, it was definitely not worth the price. $11 for six pieces is pretty hefty... and not to mention, the dumplings were $10! Be mindful that the dumplings were considered a ""starter"" and it's just average fried dumplings that you would find at any frozen aisle of an Asian grocery store. Overall the food wasn't bad but it wasn't worth the price."
51,Delicious! We arrived around 6ish to an empty restaurant and were a bit nervous but boy did that place fill up quick!! This place was delicious and we had a wonderful waitress Â will def come back!!
52,"This place is great! Delicious. Service was exceptional. I recommend stopping by and enjoying the food,Atmosphere and drinks!"
53,"I work near by so I come here for happy hour occasionally. Their appetizers and sushi are great, we always get the dumplings and a few pieces of sushi!I'd recommend trying out the scallops, they're super tender and tasty!"
54,"One of my favorites in Las Colinas! I love their bento boxes, sushi, and the crispy brussel sprouts. Everything I've tried is delicious. They have indoor dining and are adhering well to covid protocols. They check everyone's temperature upon arrival, and tables distanced apart."
55,"As you enter you are greeted, they check your temperature and give you hand sanitizer due to COVID. Overall this place has great service and amazing food!"
56,"I've been going to Little Katana in Dallas for years and since I live in Coppell, I finally decided to give the Las Colinas restaurant a try. IT'S LIGHT YEARS BETTER THAN THE COLE LOCATION!!!!!!!!!!The sushi, the rolls, and the sashimi are all fresh and delicious. I don't usually like fried/cooked protein in my rolls, but man, that Louisiana roll is SUPER GOOD.The service is impeccable and unparalleled.Great low-key ambience appropriate for all occasions (solo dining, date night, business lunch, family dinner, etc). The smooth jazz music in background is annoying to me and my music preference, but I'm sure most people are okay with it.The crispy potstickers are delicious and I recommend getting the miso soup with potstickers *IN IT* instead of the full order of potstickers.If you order special cocktails, do not be shy. Explain exactly what you want to avoid any confusion.They have sake specials sometimes so if that's your thing, take advantage. I'm not a huge sake fan so it was a little too potent for me."
57,"EXCELLENT sushi place. My family loved the sushi rolls, which were fresh, and Korean dishes, which were flavorful and tasty! The service was great. They followed CDC guidelines for safety (masks, temp checks, social distancing, etc.). We were so impressed! My family comes to this area frequently for soccer tournaments, and we will definitely return to this place to get our sushi and bulgogi fix!"
58,We loved loved loved this place. The happy hour is awesome and the food is great!! How can you not love that combo? The ambiance is really nice and the service is good. We loved everything about this place. This will be where we go for an after work happy hour for sure.
59,First time here. The dumplings where off the hook. They come with a spicy sweet sauce that made a great complementary. The sashimi was very taste. I was impressed. I bring the wife next time.
60,"Best Sushi in Town. We have visited several times. The Waitresses are very freindly and efficient....recommend the Sunny Roll, Katana Roll, seafood bowl and the hot stone bowl with Beef"
61,"This is a bustling restaurant during lunch. Since it was just me at I sat at the sushi bar. Sushi chefs were constantly working. I ordered the chefs special blue fin tuna- just ok.Louisiana roll and shrimp tempura roll on the lunch special, good size. Also ordered the jalapeÃ±o poppers which were nice, I never had those before. This is a nice local spot. However, I wouldn't come out of my way to get here."
62,"Love their hot stone bow, however, was disappointed on my last 2 delivery order that came out incorrect. Called the restaurant, manager didn't bother to come and speak to me. Sent a contact us email, no response. Bit frustrated and most likely won't be reordering again."
63,Nice quality sushi. Always fresh love the rolls. Highly recommend. Â Quick delivery times.
64,"Great Sushi place on MacArthur. I also recommend the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso paste and the Sample platter (comes with Kalbi beef short ribs, dumplings, and seared Ahi Tuna)"
65,"Ordered LK sushi special takeout. Wonderfully fresh, large slabs of fish and everything was prefect. Thank you, i couldn't be happier."
66,"Holy moly...The service here is impeccable. The food is fantastic. Let me put it this way, I have been looking for a good ""dynamite roll"" since I found the best one back in Florida several years ago. No one makes them that great and I just suffered through my life in Dallas without it... Until tonight. I finally found one made right! To top it off, there was a miscommunication about eel sauce on the rolls. We asked to put the eel sauce on the side. They brought us a side and eel sauce was also on the road. This is partially my fault for not specifying ""hey, no eel sauce on it, please put it on the side for the hubs"". They did not hesitate to take it back and get us fresh new rolls made the way I like in record timing. It was raining and the owner/manager was a gentleman. He took my child and I out under the umbrella and walked us to our car out in the parking lot. Bathrooms were clean, ambiance is great for a date and they have a kids meal with decent Mac n cheese. Wow! This place is my new favorite. Don't stop doing what you're doing, guys!"
67,"This place is worth the try. Food was great. Service was excellent. We came in on a whim. We were in the area staying the night before we flew out for vacation. The yellowtail sushi is get fresh. We ordered spicy edamame. It was kinda dry but add a little soy sauce and they were perfect. We ordered the seafood hot stone bowl, tonkotsu ramen, Japanese combo fried rice and yakisoba noodle combo and everything was perfect. Large selections of drinks, wine and liquor."
68,"Amazing food and service. Saturday night half price beers. Casual place, no need to dress up. Table seating, bar seating and sushi bar seating. Highly recommend- come hungry!"
69,Everything we got was so good. The Tiger Roll is a MUST try!! Will definitely be coming back!
70,"Recently I ate lunch at Little Kantana. It was on my yelp bookmark list of places to try. I have a coworker who frequents the restaurant and we went for sushi. While the sushi was good, it was also pretty standard. I had the spicy tuna roll and a tempura Philadelphia roll (one of my faves). I had to pay a $2 up charge for getting the one roll fried (tempura). I also had miso soup. One can easily pay about 12-15 eating here but not me apparently. Â The restaurant atmosphere was nice, spacious...good Las Colinas location. The service was also good. I can't exactly say it was overpriced, but I've gotten better lunch deals at places like sushi axiom. There's a 2 for $10 sushi menu but you're limited to choose from about 5-6 rolls. Little Katana wasn't disappointing...even satisfactory...but I've had better. I'd like to try other menu items in the future, like the Yakisoba noodles. I haven't explored the menu further yet so I'll give them that disclaimer but a 3.25-3.5 for me on LK so far. Also I'm not really a traditional sushi kind of girl. I've been a little bit spoiled by blue sushi sake and sushi axiom.Look forward to the day I leave their saying ""Hakuna Katana"" :)"
71,"Tried the Beef Yakisoba noodles and they hit the spot! Delicious fresh veggies, and a lot of them too. Satisfied my craving big time :)"
72,"Food is absolutely delicious! I love their stone bowls, pork dumplings, and sushi! This restaurant pays attention to detail and delivers amazing results. This is my favorite Asian restaurant in the Irving area and I will keep coming for more. The inside of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for date night."
73,"My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place and this restaurant popped up. We were not disappointed whatsoever! The ambiance of the place + the decor were amazing and very classy. Our server Michael was very prompt and made sure we were doing fine. He made our experience very pleasant and our foods came out very fast. You guys should ask for him!!! We ordered the Katana Combo Appetizers (The ahi tuna blew me away and was our personal favorite + very delicious dipping sauces) our entrees were the Udon Noodles and Chicken Stone Bowl (I love love love the presentation of the bowl because I love vegetables but not bean sprouts. The vegetables come out separate and then the server puts in what you like), sushi wise we got the Katana 101 and Spider Roll (Sushi rolls were very fresh) last but not least, we ended our dinner with the Mango Cheesecake and this cheesecake knockedit out of the park. The flavor to presentation was very nice and it was a very big spice to perfect for 2."
74,"Who ever said you can't find good sushi in Texas? I know someone and they sure don't know what their talking about. This place was jam packed and for a good reason. I ended up sitting at the sushi bar after I spoke to the hostess. Their sushi menu all sounded good. But, I had to go for the Charming roll and their Special roll (Fire Roll). Both were delicious and had all the right elements and flavors to make them some of my favorite sushi rolls period. Server was a little off because she had bigger parties to attend to, but other than that, this is a good sushi joint in the middle of Texas, Dallas to be specific."
75,Our favorite little sushi spot. The happy hour specials are the go-to. The hot bowls and sushi are always a good go to! Very clean. Service is always very prompt and kind.
76,"I love sushi and as soon as I moved to the Las Colinas area a couple of months ago I've been in search for my ""go-to."" I've tried 3 others nearby but this has been the best so far. The flavorings coupled with the freshness felt spot on. Definitely want another go but I'm feeling like this is one!"
77,"Came here with a girlfriend for dinner and enjoyed the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. The dark tablecloths add a fancy touch to the place that has a full bar, sushi bar, and a good amount of tables and seating. The waitress was attentive and came by often to check on us. We ordered the salmon sashimi, teardrop yellowtail, spicy tuna roll, and the Katana 101 roll. Â The salmon sashimi was good but not the best I've had. Â The teardrop yellowtail sashimi comes with three big tuna sashimi slices in ponzu sauce with jalapeÃ±o and sriracha. Â It was good and the tuna was fresh and meaty. Â The spicy tuna was your typical spicy tuna; nothing out of this world. The Katana 101 roll was delicious and I loved the creaminess from the cream cheese and the sauces. Excellent choice if you like cream cheese in your sushi rolls. All in all, food and service was good and the restaurant was clean and welcoming. I would come back here again if I'm in the area and craving sushi!"
78,"Went to this place with my coworkers. It totally exceed my expectations. It was well priced for the quality of food. It had such a great presence in Las Colinas. I personally believe it's up to par with Blue Fish. I would highly recommended the stone bowl. It was so yummy and tasty. It was really good as far savory, spices, and everything that was included. Will for sure be returning"
79,"Wow is all you can say about this place. Â The sushi is amazing, the ramen was the bomb, and from the photos you can see that my niece loved the edamame! Â We basically went down the list of all the specialty rolls. Â The roll all the way to the right is the crab baked roll and you can see how much crab is piled up on top of it! Â It was basically the best roll I have ever had - unbelievable. Â The dynamite rolls we are also amazing and had a great spice pallet to them. Â Check out the soft shell crab roll, it's the one with the crabs sticking out of them, they were amazing. Â the crab was cooked perfectly and the components of the roll were put together nicely. Â Each roll had a unique flavor and definitely didn't disappoint. Â My niece got the chicken ramen and she almost finished the whole thing! Â The portions are large and the wait staff is extremely attentive. Â Every time a plate was finished they were right there to take it away from the table. Â Some people may find this as annoying or overbearing but this is exactly how a restaurant is supposed to act in a foreign country. Â It's nice to see this level of attention here in the US. Â Great job!"
80,I got the deluxe platter. The sashimi and nigiri didn't taste very fresh. The California roll and shrimp tempura rolls were pretty good.
81,YummmmmmYummmmmmThe chicken here is great and sushi was fantastic and the place is very cute and classyGreat for lunch
82,"Wow, wow, wow! Little Katana, you have totally surprised me! We had tried to dine here once before, but it was closed even with the Open sign lit during business hours. I am super glad we gave them another try.The doors were unlocked this time (lol) and we were greeted immediately and escorted to a table. Our waitress, Sungae, was phenomenal. She explained the menu and took our drink order. I like rice-less sushi rolls and she pointed out the options on the menu, which Â included not one but three in which to choose. We first started the dinner with the Ahi tuna tower. This was wonderful, with nice chunks of avocado mixed with tuna, rice, and crab. It was different than what we are used to, and this was not a bad thing.Next came the Ma Ma Roll... Ma Ma Mia, this was beyond delicious! This was one of the rice-less rolls, wrapped with scrumptious salmon this literally melted in my mouth. Yes, it was that fresh! Filled tightly in the salmon was crab meat, avocado and topped with a ponzu sauce. Trust me, you must try this!After we demolished the Ma Ma Roll, our spicy tuna roll (pretty much a staple we usually order) was served that was tasty. Also arriving to the table was the Charming Roll, another rice-less roll with crab, salmon, avocado and chili sauce. Yum, yum and YUM! We all but licked the plate and we were not the least bit hungry after all of that, but we ordered another Ma Ma Roll just because it was that fricken good! Yep, glutinous people we are! We were celebrating my birthday, so I used that as an excuse-- worked for me!Our waitress, Sungae, checked on us often without being intrusive. What stood out the most to say she was excellent at her job? OK, I have only witnessed this two other times in my life, and it was in Arizona at a nice restaurant and when dining in Japan. As we were ordering, she would thank us. When she refilled our water and we thanked her, SHE THANKED US. This is pretty much a custom in Japan but certainly not in America, sadly. Just by that small gesture of appreciation, I was beyond impressed. I will most definitely be returning. Their food blew away their competitors in this area. Thank you, Sungae, for making my birthday celebration an enjoyable one Â :)"
83,Every sushi that we ordered were good. Â I like the spider roll the best and the crab dynamite.Their crispy calamari is one of the best I have tasted in different restaurant. Â It's crispy and yummy. Â The sizzling dumpling is also good!We Â got Â here around 6:30 and they are still offering happy hour for the beers.I just did not eat the raw ones as I am not really into that but my husband and nephew loved it.We will surely be coming back.
84,Great spot! Â Decent selection of sushi options. Bento boxes looked really good. Quick for lunch.
85,Absolutely Â worst sushi ever! The fish was NOT fresh. We had to make a Wendy's run to get the taste out of our mouths! The only saving Â grace was the miso soup & beef dumplings. A lot of money down the drain. Don't think we'll order from here again.
86,This place is my go to for sushi! Amazing service and goooodd fooodd! Highly recommend. This is my regular spot for HH with the squad or nice dinner with the boyfriend.
87,"The ambiance is great. Hostess and waiter were awesome. They continually checked on us at appropriate times. The sushi was delicious and the noodle chicken soup was delicious! Actually they were the best noodles I've had at a restaurant. Overall I will definitely be back again, and I highly recommend."
88,"My wife and I ate here 2 weeks ago and loved it. Â We were lucky to arrive at a time when Sake bottles were half off, so given we were in town for TexSom (a wine conference) Â we were to splurge on an $80 bottle of Hakutsuru. Â The udon was wonderful, as were the various pieces of sushi we tried. Â What sets this place apart from others are some of the dishes are traditional Japanese home fare, and we'll be back to try those. Â 5 stars!"
89,"I really enjoyed my lunch here the other day. The service was very prompt and friendly.Little Katana has a lot to offer for lunch and dinner. I have been on a ramen kick and to my surprise they had some here. The reason for my surprise was that I thought it was just a sushi place. I ordered the tonkotsu type ramen and I'm glad I did. It was very tasty and had all of the good fixings for this type of ramen. My complaint though about the ramen was that the broth seemed to be lacking something. Besides that the meat in the ramen was delectable, and the noodles were made just right.My California roll was very fresh and tasted great.Overall I had a great time here and I look forward to coming back."
90,"The seafood hot stone bowl ($16, if I remember correctly) was simply one of the best things I have eaten anywhere. It seemed to have a flavor I don't normally associate with Japanese food, or any Asian food for that matter. Service was extra friendly and prompt, the ambiance was very nice, and I'll definitely return soon."
91,"Me and my coworkers have been waiting for this place to open for several months, ever since we saw the ""Coming Soon"" signs! Â We often ate at rheir uptown location when we officed over there and were more than excited to see them expanding to Las Colinas! Â The day has finally arrived and we came here for lunch...It was delicious and the service was unbelievable. Â I am truly excited to have these folks in the neighborhood."
92,We love Little Katana - Las Colinas! They take great care of us and have the best food! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good quality sushi and friendly service!
93,"I took my family there as the reviews came up for a Thai restaurant. This is definitely not Thai, it's Japanese - having said that, it's really good. Do try the Last Emperor's Mule, delicious. Â All the sushis and sashimis we ordered were perfectly made and kudos to our server, the shellfish allergy in one of our party was well noted and respected. If anything, the service was a little slow, only because the restaurant was full. But if you're not dying of hunger, this isn't the worst thing in the world."
94,"Sushi was amazing! A little pricy for some of the speciality rolls, but very tasty! the katana 101 and the dragon roll were sooooo good."
95,"I ordered for delivery, because I'm in a work trip and peopled out, so delivery was perfect through the yelp app. It was early!I ordered both the Louisiana roll and the Mama roll, and they were both good. Let me tell you, though... The Mama roll... It was incredible. A perfect mix of flavors and textures. I will be back. As often and soon as possible!!"
96,"Amazing! Service, presentation and of the food on point, taste. Overall, excellent experience."
97,"First off I have to say this is probably some of the best sushi I've ever eaten in my life. Since I've been eating sushi for over 50 years I'd say that's something. We tried a variety of different sushi plates while here and I took some photos. The service was quick and friendly, and the only reason I can't give it five stars is partly because of the tea and the hours this place is open. I always have some hot green tea when I have Asian food, with no sugar and a fairly neutral taste it doesn't interfere with the rest of the taste that you're looking for when you're eating. Here it was just served to me in a giant cup instead of a teapot and a cup. We arrived at 4:30 in the afternoon and they don't open until 5 PM so we had to wait a half an hour. I'm glad we waited as the sushi was outstanding, but they could increase their hours as far as I'm concerned. Â Anyway if you're looking for some good sushi if you happen to be in the area try this place it's far better than most places you'll ever eat sushi, and I've eaten sushi pretty much everywhere I go."
98,"Great food, reasonable prices, cute and nicely decorated. Four stars because the service can be slow (they've been packed every time I've gone so I'm assuming that's why!)"
99,"Nice location and good service. They have some nIce rolls if you are a roll eater. Sushi was good. I had the tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and unagi."
100,"LOVE THIS PLACE! Â I've been here a couple of times for happy hour/light dinner and a few times for lunch. It gets pretty busy at lunch time. Don't expect a quick lunch. The food is fresh and really good here. It's hard to order sushi if you're not splitting it and want to try different things. For lunch, you can order from a select menu of sushi 2 rolls for $10. I love the rest of their lunch menu too. You can order the usual bentos for variety. The salads look good too. My friend had the hot stone bowl and loved it. I'll have to try it, but Â it's hard to not order the sushi. Everything I've had here has been really good. I've introduced this place to several co workers who come in from out of town and now this is where they want to go. They have a good happy hour with special prices on sushi and appetizers and Wednesday is half price wine bottle night. Can't beat that!"
101,Great place for a quick lunch. Service was fast and attentive. Prices were good for lunch. Very busy place. Will definitely be back.
102,Tried this place for the first time and it was amazing. The petite woman that was my server has excellent customer service. Food was great quality. Would definitely recommend.
103,"This is one of the best Japanese restaurant that I have visited. Great environment, great service and great kitchen.This is the order to share for 4:- Hot & spicy chicken soup Â - Sunny Roll - Hot Stone Rice (combo) - careful, it's very spicy - Mango cheesecake or mochi mochi ice cream Â - Sapporo (draft beer)You're welcome"
104,"This place is amazing. Restaurant decor is very good. Service is excellent! Awesome music and wonderful food. The crabmeat dynamite is so fresh, good and filling. I have traveled and had this in all parts of the country. It is the best here!"
105,I went to get rolls and was not pleased with taste of the fish. Or I should say lack there of. It's bland and you have to dip it into soy sauce a lot to give it some kind of taste. My friend had a rice dish and she liked it. Two stars for that.
106,"First visit- will be back. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked amazing! Has a very elegant atmosphere, love the modern industrial look. Perfect place for a date night."
107,"I was in town for business and stumbled upon this gem! Great quality sushi and the service was pretty good. We ordered an appetizer that was forgotten, but other than that, everything came as expected and was delicious. Also, we loved the half priced wine special on Saturday night!"
108,Very good food! I had spicy Â Tina rolls with soy paper. Service was very good even though it was packed! I sat at the sushi bar and the ambience was very nice. Highly recommend if you like sushi!
109,great chef but little too salty for us. I was little disappointed that they didn't have yummy sauce.. Â their sushi was good
110,"I'm from houston and we came to dallas for a mini vacation and i wanted some ramen nearby for my birthday. this place is so cute and super friendly! we all got tonkatsu, shoyu ramen, california roll, spicy chicken, dumplings and everything was amazing!! definitely recommend coming here."
111,"This is strictly for the ramen. I ordered online which was nice and easy, lemon breezy. I pick it up and the broth was nice and hot! They package the broth and the noodles separate which is awesome. I also ordered the Cali roll, but I'm not doing a review on that. The reason is if you had one Cali roll you've had them all. Back to that ramen tho! The broth was so flavorful. Full of garlic which I like. The noodles were a little soft for my taste but enjoyable. I love the seaweed that was in the ramen. I know that the egg is supposed to be soft boiled, but I prefer it hard boiled which it was by the time I got around to eating it. I got a peek of the interior and it was nice. Next time I'll dine in!"
112,Little pricey for size of rolls but delicious. Love the Brussels sprouts! Friendly staff and easy option for takeout.
113,"The sushi was very good, really fresh. I ordered a Katana 101 roll, Charisma roll and sizzling dumplings. I highly recommend this place."
114,"this place is amazing! we found out about it about a year ago and have loved it ever since! they are always very consistent, and the food is delicious! we alsways enjoy our time there and the precautions they take to combat coronavirus are very comforting, when we walked in, we were required to use hand sanitizer and we got our temperature checked, which really made me feel safe, while we were there they were constantly cleaning, which gave my whole group peace of mind about our safety. if your are looking for a delicious place to eat sushi and DELICIOUS sizzling dumplings, this is the place to go! (my favorite is the Philadelphia roll, they add cucumber,and it is delicious)"
115,"Amazing! Amazing food, amazing hospitality, amazing service.Spontaneous meeting - my wife missed her flight and was spending the night by DWF, my son was visiting for a business meeting next day and I was only one hour away after a meeting. Â So we met here for dinner and it was just wonderful!!"
116,"We sat at the sushi bar and had the Snow Mountain Roll, Special Dragon Roll, and the PaPa Roll. All three were wonderful! The Pa Pa Roll in particular is very special - no rice, so fresh. Just a really lovely sushi experience! Highly recommend!"
117,"One of my favorite sushi places! Very kind, helpful, and attentive staff. Fresh, delicious food and good options even for those who don't like sushi. We come here a lot!"
118,"Love that this place has a presence in Las Colinas! It has the quality of its rival Blue Fish with more competitive prices.I've only tried their sushi, but the bento boxes look great as well. They have tons of special rolls and I haven't been disappointed.Service can be a little slower than desired at lunch-if you're in a rush.Nice relaxing environment, table cloths and it isn't too loud at all. Great place for a business meeting"
119,"Simple but pretty good! Some of their fish is brought from Japan without being frozen. These pieces are the most expensive but the rest are pretty reasonable. Everything tasted good. Popular dishes Â are Charming and Pappa Shushi. The creme brulee is really tasty. The mango cheesecake not that much. I think the mango fruit was not mature enough. Both are house made :)Service was super helpful and friendly. Fortunately, we arrived just in time for happ hour. Decor was cute and simple since Christmas is coming :) Entrance might not invite you but the inside is nice :D"
120,Very yummy good! Definitely worth trying! Had a hot stone bowl kinda thing.. It was really good! Give it a shot!
121,"I am giving Little Katna a 4 star review since I have to return. Â I took my wife there at 4 pm on Saturday and it was between Lunch and Dinner. Â  We have eaten at the neighboring Blue Fish and we wanted to try to new Sushi Place in town. We did bring our 14 month old and the staff was very accommodating. We had the Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura. Â It was tasty with large shrimp but not too oily. Â I also had the Katana House Salad and everything was fresh. Â Finally, we had two rolls which consisted of Rainbow Roll and the Dragon Roll. Â I thought it was very tasty. I will return again during dinner with my wife and update my review. Overall, I think is a great new addition to Las Colinas for good sushi."
122,I ordered take out with tuna rolls and the seafood stone bowl. Â The sushi didn't have much flavor but the seafood stone bowl was outstanding.loaded with fresh vegetables and plenty of seafood. Â And it was not too spicy for my sensitive palate. Â The portion is large enough for two to share.
123,Definitely a hidden gem in Las Colinas. The staff is always so friendly and the sushi is amazing and fresh!
124,"Y'all. This sushi is straight fuego. All the ingredients were super fresh - rice, fish, veggies... like. Yaasss. Some of the best I've had in a long time."
125,Best sushi I've had in a very long time. Â Get the lemon sushi roll!!!!! Â Pa pa I think it's called
126,"Fantastic! We came on a Thursday night and were greeted immediately by a friendly host. We were sat and service was prompt. Our waiter was friendly and informative about various dishes. His recommendation of avocado egg rolls was spot on. I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls. I'd almost be willing to drive back the 4 hours from home to eat them again. Â We both had sushi including the Spicy California, Philadelphia Roll, Louisiana Roll and Spider Roll (I think, I remember it had salmon and Katana sauce). All were delicious. The price was reasonable for all items and while I didn't drink they had some great sounding cocktails."
127,"We go to little katana all the time. The other day I called to make an order Togo for a salmon tower and fried rice. The lady repeated my order with salmon tower and fried rice--just like I ordered. I go to pick it up and it's a salmon salad? It was a complete waste of time, I only have 30 minute lunches. And her response was it's gonna be a minute to fix it? Totally not accommodating. The customer service is not nearly as good as the food!"
128,Great little place for a sit down asian fusion meal. I had the hot pot with a crispy rice bowl. They have a great selection for lunch but expensive for dinner.
129,"Get the yellowtail if you don't do anything else because it is phenomenal. Vino and sushi specials even on a Saturday afternoon which is when we went. Seaglass pinot noir went perfect with our meal. Everything is fresh and the waitstaff is very accommodating. Also try the ahi tuna tower but beware is has a seriously spicy kick to it. This place is actually a tad smaller than I would have expected inside. But it makes for a wonderful little date day or night. There are lots of specialty rolls on the menu or just straight sashimi/traditional items if you'd like to keep things simple. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Yes, it's way way better than that other sushi joint down the street and around the corner. There, I said it."
130,Yummy Â food! Excellent service & great Â fresh sushi . I really enjoyed my dinner tonight. Sushi at this location is worth every penny.
131,"Little Katana has become my go-to restaurant for sushi in the DFW area. There is very little... from the atmosphere, to the service, and especially the food... that I don't love about this restaurant. My most recent visit (my second) was notable because of the friendliness of the staff, in spite of my arriving very close to closing time. My food was excellent, tasting very fresh and presented in a lovely manner.Must try items include their sizzling dumpling miso soup and crabmeat dynamite roll. I'm sure I will find others on future visits, and their will be future visit!"
132,"I've used my $15 dollars grand opening credit for four weeks now and haven't had any more issues, so I'm going to bump up Little Katana one more star. Service has been great and the manager and staff have been polite. The restaurant is more lively during the lunch hours. Haven't went back for dinner again to see if it got busier, since it can be pretty pricey here depending on what you order. I've tried quite a few things on the menu, so below is a quick summary. Most of the food at Little Katana is a 3-5 depending on what you order.-Sizzling dumpling are pretty good here, but Americanized and fried. -chicken teriyaki lunch bento- chicken was pretty salty.-Blue crab roll tasted cooked and is kind of fishy. Wouldn't order this again.-Cosmo roll is pretty decent. -Beef sizzling hot stone bowl is pretty good, but a bit pricey and Americanized. Definitely not Japanese or Korean.-Jungle albacore was removed from the Happy Hour menu. I don't think I'd pay a full $18 for it. It didn't taste as good the second time around. I think they seared the albacore more and I prefer it more raw. I looked at the previous picture I took of this dish and they didn't sear it the first time. It was better that way! Maybe ask for it raw and not seared if you want to get this.-Shrimp tempura roll - pretty good and standard-beef bugolgi lunch bento- pretty solid and not as salty as the chicken teriyaki thankfully, the salad dressing on the side salad is pretty tasty. you also get edamame, 4 pc california roll, and miso soup. definitely a good bang for your buck-Beef teriyaki lunch bento- beef is prepared really well. One of my favorites-Ahi tuna or salmon tower- also one of my favorites. I would ask for light spicy mayo next time. They went a bit overboard the second time I ordered this.-Little Star Lunch special- fish is pretty fresh. Comes with 4 nigiri and a crunch roll. Salmon is better than the tuna here.They also changed the happy hour menu a bit. Albacore jungle and cosmo roll was definitely taken off the happy hour menu, when it had been previously on there. I'm sure they took a few other things of it, but just be aware it's a little bit more limited now.----Update: Bentos include tempura now!!"
133,"Wonderful fresh sushi, great service. Will def visit again next time I'm in town."
134,This place is the best! The food is amazingly delicious. I'm from out of the state and I make sure I come here when I visit.
135,"Sunny Roll!From what I saw online yesterday this place has only been open since January 23rd, and it is a great place to go and get some sushi. Â I was looking for a sushi place in Irving / Las Colinas area that looked decent in the online pictures and that seemed to be clean. Â There were several sushi places in Irving that came up but oh my goodness....some looked very scary online. Â We had two orders of edamame, which were demolished...but you cant really mess up edamame...can you?!?! Â maybe you can, I dont know?!? The tables have black table cloths and glasses already at the table...very fancy!Of course I am not a true raw fish eater, but I love the shrimp tempura roll and the spicy tuna roll. Â The tuna seemed fresh. The staff here were friendly and eager to help you with your selections and get you taken care of. Â I will definitely be back if we are ever in that area again. Restrooms = N/AI believe the owner was there last night and took our order and at the end of the meal gave the kiddo that was with us a mint. Â The kiddo kept asking for desert but he was not alowed, next best thing!"
136,"I think maybe I ordered the wrong thing here as all plates and sushi that were being delivered to surrounding tables looked fantastic. Â I was craving Tonkotsu Ramen so I ordered and what I was served was-well a bowl of noodles in a very delicious broth with half a hard boiled egg (the most disappointing part-that soft boiled, runny middle egg is my fav part), one thinly sliced piece of pork (I assume it was pork belly but it was so thinly sliced it looked like a piece of curled up bacon). Â Pork did have great flavor but it was not what I used to getting-there has been around atleast 2 (most places 3) slices of thick pork belly-another reason why I love this bowl so much. Overall, between the hard boiled egg-which was cooked to death and definitely not from any chicken that had any room to roam (yolk was almost white) - and oh so thin piece of pork, I was completely disappointed. Â Next year when I am in town vist maybe I try something other then the Ramen so I can see why this place had so many stars"
137,Visiting from out of town and chose this place because of the reviews and it was close to our hotel. Went on a Saturday night and was greeted immediately and sat. Live music was being played and decor is very contemporary. Our waitress and service was excellent. Ordered the ramen and lobster roll along with a Katana martini. Everything was amazing. We've been to some of the best sushi places around and this is up there at the top. From service to the quality of the food was the best we've seen in a long time in the US. My husband actually loved it and asked the waitress to give the regards to the chef and he is the most picky sushi eater ever! Wish they had a Little Katana in our area because we'd literally live there!
138,"The staff is friendly and helpful. The ambiance is nice. The food is good. I've been here twice now. As far as sushi goes, is good, but not great. The roll sizes are a little below average in my opinion. The fish is fresh though. I've had the Snow Mountain and the Lobster roll. I recommend both, but there are little tweaks they could do to really make the flavor explode."
139,"one star because they work with uber eats. they had one job, and that was to deliver a tasty scallop dynamite roll. FAIL. the scallops were raw (i cooked them myself because i am used to them being baked) and the roll was swimmmmmmming in spicy mayo. it was disgusting. i scraped off all of the excess. had the roll not been almost $20, i would have thrown it away. i was too busy working on homework to drive to blue fish-big mistake that i won't make again. i really wanted to like this place!"
140,"I love this place! Great option for indoor or outdoor sitting! Betsy busy but that's because the food is so great!Quality sushi, colorful, flavorful and plentiful!!! Amazing menu and lots of choices.Great location and always nice crowed to dine with. Highly recommended! Always great experience dining there!"
141,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Funny thing is I'm not into seafood at all so I can't comment on the sushi, but I had the beef hot stone bowl and it was probably the best one I've ever had in my life. Tender bulgogi type beef is served hot over rice with an egg cooking on top. Fresh veggies are also brought to the table and stirred in table side, then fresh lemon is squeezed on top. I wish I had a 'before pic' because the presentation is beautiful. The beef is top quality - no fat or gristle. I'm here at an odd time (that's kind of my thing) so I'm the only person here, but there's a beautifully appointed bar, sushi bar, and a piano presumably for some live music sets on the weekend. The service was impeccable.Come patronize this place! I can't wait to bring my hubs here as he loves seafood."
142,"The service here was outstanding, everyone was very nice. The food was really good. The dumplings had a great taste. The sushi was done very well. Â Try getting food items from the Happy Hour. Better prices, same great food."
143,"Great food and service, the mango cheesecake is amazing! We had the teriyaki chicken and filet with a side of mushrooms and spinach and everything was great"
144,Loved this sushi place! Very authentic and lovely place. Great service and we always order the quail egg shooters! Â They have a nice happy hour as well. We definitely will be back!
145,"Absolutely best sushi I've ever had, great temperature and cuts, friendly staff... loved it!"
146,FantasticHighly recommend this placeI had the following nigiri:Fresh SalmonYellowtail Maguro TunaFatty (Otoro)UniAnd the hot stone Wagyu.All super fresh and quality rice to go with
147,Best sushi place in the DFW area. Sushi is fresh and delicious. Staff is friendly and inviting. Super chill place.
148,This is my favorite new sushi spot. Dumplings are amazing! We loved both of the rolls we ordered as well.
149,"Came here for date night with my husband and it was such a cute little spot! Drinks were great. Sushi was so tasty! The waitress was so sweet, polite, and attentive. We will definitely be returning."
150,"I love the dragon boat sushi!!!!!!! Loved the interior design too! My friends order Ramen, they were just okay."
151,Great customer Service and amazing food!! Â We had the avocado eggs rolls and 4 different types of sushi and nothing was a disappointment. Â We also had a cab fromthe happy hour menu that was delicious. Â Will definitely come back again!!!
152,This was a great little place! My colleague had the sushi and I enjoyed both dumplings and a stone bowl. The food was delicious and the service was excellent.
153,Excellent food choices raw and cooked. Great happy hour menu. Great staff and excellent customer service. Will come back.
154,Let's just say we will come back. Such delicious and fresh sushi & food. The customer service was amazing as well! Thank you from a couple traveling through Texas all the way from Washington state!
155,"I am so happy to find chef Suzuki here! Â The sushi was fresh and the service was good. It was a little pricey, but not overly so. We will be back!"
156,"I was in the mood for ramen so decided to get some from this place based on the yelp reviews. I've since had the ramen again (first time the kimchi one and second time chicken). The ramen here is delicious and the service for takeout is also really good. The restaurant seems cute and pretty popular. However, my kimchi ramen had one piece of pork and my chicken one barely had any meat. Just not what i expected for some soup that costs $10. Not sure if they are only skimping on the take out ramen since i didn't dine in, but it's disappointing enough for me to consider not returning."
157,I really liked little katana! It was pretty big place. They had a lot of options and the service was very friendly. I had the avocado and veggie roll which was really good and the veggie rolls looked beautiful. The service was fast and the pricing was competitive. I will definitely be visiting again.
158,"I found my new happy hour spot. Â Great drinks, food and ambience. Â Attentive staff, perfectly price for 5p M-F Happy Hour. Â On the way home Â just got better. Â Went twice in 1 week, reminds me of my ole stompin ground Hapa in Colorado. Â Jalapeno Peppers is just like that Monkey Brain- salmon, avocados, delicious. Â If you in Irving/Las Colinas its the spot for sushi. Â I'm bougie about my sushi!!!"
159,"I am happy a good quality sushi place opened walkable distance from my place. I've been to Little Katana couple times now, and both times, foods were pretty good. Sushi rolls and tempura udon are my go to items, and they have been consistently good. During the happy hour, you can get appetizers at great price! I would definitely visit many more times."
160,"I went on my lunch break to check out this new place. I've seen popular and prominent locals post about Little Katana on social media and I wanted to see what it was all about. This is definitely the hangout spot where you not only want to be seen but experience great food! Modern Edison-style light fixtures produce soft light against a mostly black and light brick dining room. Three-dimensional art, and other modern paintings hang from the brick walls. It has a very fresh vibe. There is a small bright fully loaded bar near the entrance and the well-lit sushi bar is located at the back of the restaurant. I started my meal out with the Sizzlin' Dumplings. It's a semi-crunchy, fried dumpling with a finely minced beef and vegetable filling, served with a sweet plum sauce and a sweet chili sauce. The amount of dumplings make for a great sharable appetizer. Â I'm typically a sushi hound but I branched out and got their most popular dish, the Hot Stone Bowl. It is a mixture of meat, rice, veggies, and meats served in an actual stone bowl. It sizzles. Red peppers, green peppers, radish, mushrooms, carrots and sprouts all finely chopped. Lemon wedge for a nice touch of acidity. The waiter asked me if I wanted all the veggies on the plate, I said yes. If I didn't go all in, I'd have to go home. The waitress gently dumped in all the ingredients and began to mix the bowl. By the time she was done, the egg yolk was cooked and the veggies were no longer raw. The customizable component is good for deciding how spicy you want this to be.  Â The Hot Stone Bowl sounds exotic but the taste and texture and flavor are similar to that of hibachi, only lighter, less salty and buttery. It is more reliant on natural flavors from the veggies and meats - which is pure deliciousness.What makes Little Katana unique is the quality and freshness of ingredients. Their chefs prepare new batches of sushi rice three times per day."
161,"Little Katana is a hidden gem in Las Colinas. The jalapeÃ±o poppers were amazing! They were stuffed full of crab meat and lightly fried. The pan fried dumplings were served on a sizzling plate and also had great flavor! For lunch you can even get two sushi rolls for $10, an absolute steal!"
162,"Good sushi, overpriced combo... read below.Menu should read sashimi, nigiri, and a roll for $75... then I would have steered clear. Â Instead it just says large sushi and sashimi combo. Â The sashimi pieces were big but the nigiri was nothing to write home about.Let me count, 16 piece of sashimi (4x4) plus 4 sets of nigiri (4x2) and a roll = $75... when it would have been cheaper if ordered a la cart... so what's the point? Â No flair nor any discount.Fool me once, never again."
163,"This place is amazing. Cute atmosphere. Sometimes they even have live music. Super nice servers. Food is DELICIOUS. Favorite meals: hot stone bow with chicken, lobster roll, crawfish dynamite ""roll"", ahi tuna tower. Quite pricey BUT worth it."
164,The service and food was awesome. Everyone was extremely friendly! Our sushi chef Evan and waitstaff Thuy were awesome! Going back!!
165,"We went here on a Monday night, trying to grab a quick bite. Unfortunately, it was anything by quick. It took 20 minutes to just see a waiter, only after I got up and found the manager. The food was so so. Not the best choice."
166,It's my favorite place in town for the Japanese food. Must try their appetizers and deserts too. Great service too.
167,"From the moment we walked in, I knew we would enjoy Little Katana. The greeter and servers were extremely friendly. I loved the ambiance of the black cloth tablecloths and Edison bulb lighting. It was my first time to try sushi in many years, and our server took time to help me pick out something I would like. I got the Sunshine Roll and it was fabulous. Very delicious. The udon was good too. The broth has really good flavor. My husband was scared to try sushi, so he got grilled salmon. The orange ginger flavor was unique and delicious.Their bathrooms are nice too, which you don't usually see in a restaurant this size.On our way out, we were repeatedly thanked by every single member of the staff: multiple servers, the greeter, and even the bartender said goodnight.I have not felt so welcomed at a meal in a very long time! Truly gracious service."
168,"Love this place!!!! Wonderful customer service, fresh sushi&sashimi! Very impressed:) I'll definitely come back for more."
169,"Great sushi was surpassed by and with informative and entertaining Sushi Specialist Nuke. Â Would have given 13 Stars but your only allowed to provide five. Â  Have been wanting to try Little Katana in downtown Dallas for a long time and this was the next best option. Â We reccomed you eat at the Sushi bar and meet ""The Nuke"" in person.You will not be disappointed!!!!"
170,Good food with nice options on the menu. Quiet the night we went but looks like a nice spot for a date night or night out with friends
171,Great food! Our party of 12 from work enjoy the various dishes. My Seafood Stone Bowl is delicious.
172,"Overall great experience. New to this area and trying to find some go to spots. The service was great. They even have happy hour on Friday which was a a great surprise. With some appetizers half off and discounted drinks what's not to like. The sushi was also really really good. It is a little crowded with the way the tables are set up inside. They are really close to each other, so if you want more of a roomy private feel this is probably not the place to go."
173,"My first time at this restaurant. I have eatenat their smaller version, which is a sushi bar in the Galleria Mall in north Dallas, which has excellent sushi. Today's service was very fast and very friendly and I was impressed. I ordered a Bento box with hot tea and they brought the mug out which was huge compared to what you normally get at a Japanese restaurant. I had the bulgogi which was very tasty indeed. The California roll was excellent as was the steamed rice and the shrimp Tempura. I gave it five stars and when I am back in the area, I will definitely eat here again. I think salmon teriyaki is next on my list..."
174,"My new go-to sushi place. I used to love Blue Fish which is across the street but it's always such a pain to get a table there so I ventured to a few different places. Â I hear they have great happy hour specials too although I don't usually go at that time. Sushi rolls are good, their sashimi is very fresh. I'm giving it four stars because I reserve 5 for the best / on par with the top sushi places and I'd say this is as good as it gets locally but comparing it to NYC or SF, it's obviously not the same. But if you are stuck in Dallas and want decent sushi, I've searched and searched all the local areas and this is my go to."
175,Nothing extraordinarily unique about the menu but the service was outstanding! I got the scallop dynamite and was so sad to leave any behind but the portions are huge!! Definitely a good value.
176,"This place gets a 4 stars for the food. I loved every sushi roll I ordered, I even took an extra roll home. But when it came to getting the bill it was certainly an unpleasant experience. *I updated this review and deleted the bill experience because I appreciate the fact the establishment took the time to react to my review, hoping it would help everybody in the end. I hope this was just one of those days.But all by all... the sushi was very good and we will certainly be back for more, soon ..."
177,"Tried this place for the first time today and was thoroughly impressed. It's smaller, more intimate, and less crowded than Blue Fish, my typical sushi haunt in this area, which made for a much calmer dining experience.I sat at the sushi bar and had the yellowtail diamond back roll and the chef's choice 6 piece Sushi plate, both of which were extraordinary. The chef I spoke to during my meal, Nuke, was especially helpful and friendly, and the wait staff in general was attentive and quick. It's a bit pricey, as good sushi typically is, but definitely worth the money for a nice meal out."
178,Good sushi - nothing mind blowing. My boyfriend and I ate here and we enjoyed our meal. It was nothing to rave over but we would come back here again if we wanted some sushi and were in the area.
179,Great place! It was our first time going We went for happy hour had three rolls and love the dumplings so much we ordered another round. Their team was friendly and recommend things for us to try. We will be back for more
180,"First time going in, even though I pass the restaurant all the time. Â We went for Happy Hour, not knowing that it's over at 6 on Fridays. Â The server was great, we rushed to get our order in time before she said the ""happy hour button"" went away. Â Food was good, great service. Â We will come back earlier."
181,I'm jealous of you people that can afford to eat here for lunch. We came here on a Sunday evening date night. I was surprised how many people were here.We had the:Yellowtail sashimiBrussels sproutsBeef stonebowlCocktailsAll was good. I look forward to exploring the menu further.
182,"First time visiting this restaurant. Very nice ambiance. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Very good sushi menu and it was delicious. My friend had seafood rice bowl. It came out steaming hot, they mix it for you and it was delicious. It included all types of seafood and fish. I will be back!"
183,"This little random restaurant is the cutest thing I have seen. It reminds me of my days in DC, where you can find a quiet, tucked away eating joint that makes you feel like you found a treasure. Atmosphere: I like sitting outside, in the patio. It is place between 2 building walls. You look on to the locals walking by with their dogs, friends, coffees, book bags, etc. It can get a bit loud, but not so loud that you cannot have a conversation. Food: A-to-the-mazing. Go for the Hot Pot. Wow. The sauce is mixture of all the flavors, that ends with a spicy note. Drinks: Delicious and perfectly potent. These drinks were made with perfection. They did not leave you begging for more alcohol or mixer in them."
184,Nice and welcoming ambiance. Great service and recommendations by our server. The staff was also quite attentive to my family. The sushi itself was really delicious. Made fresh and brought out fairly quickly. We will definitely be going back again soon.
185,"This seems to be an upscale restaurant given the black tablecloths and people dressed up in suits dining here on a weekday, but it's not really the type of place to bring clients too if you're looking to impress.The prices are very decent but so is the food. I ordered tonkotsu ramen and was full at the end of the the meal, but not necessarily satisfied. The broth was too thin and lacked the creamy flavor I was looking for, and the noodles were mostly likely from a package."
186,"Wonderful happy hour and nice waitstaff. Must get the Sizzling dumplings! Â Even when it's not happy hour, prices are very reasonable."
187,"This is a good place. It's pricy though and set like spirit airlines. Base dish price is listed and then tog pay more for anything and everything. Want tofu, 4 more, mushrooms 2 more, avocado 3 more. You get the gist. Nice ambiance so it is expected to be charged extra but I just didn't like theserver telling me it was gonna be so and so more for everything that I wanted in a dish. Still 4 for food, ambiance and decent service"
188,Update 12/26 - found out from management that there is no alcohol/sake in the sushi rice. Knowing that I might give the place another try. Previous review:We wanted to get sushi at little katana but found out that they put Sake in their sushi rice :/ which is not ok due to religious restrictions. They should put that on their menu.Also - not sure if the waitress was having a bad day but she wasn't the friendliest and got annoyed when we were asking questions regarding dietary restrictions.We had appetizers but left before the main course since we could not eat the sushi. I recommend the brussel sprouts - they were delicious!
189,Great food! We got sushi as well as some spicy chicken! I honestly didn't expect much from the chicken but it was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. They have a wasabi mashed potatoes.... you need this if you love wasabi!
190,"Best restaurant I will likely not go to again. My wife and I went last night. The service was prompt, courteous and very attentive. Â We had two rolls and two different types of sushi with miso soup.The soup was very good and the entrees were fresh and nicely presented. Thay also had tamari avaliable which is a plus for my wife. So if you want very good sushi and a nice experience, go hereNow, why will I not return? Â Upon walking up to the door, they have both 30.06 and 30.07 signs. These are signs in Texas that make concealed or open carry of firearms unlawful. Â We consider not going in but chose to leave our weapons in the car and eat. As I said, the restaurant was great but law abiding citizens leave their weapons in the car. Criminals do not. Â I will frequent establishments that respect our 2nd Amendment rights"
191,This place is fantastic! The staff is very cordial and quick to meet your needs! Â Great wine list and a few local brews that seem to be very popular! Warm sake as well as many other varieties of sake.
192,Love this little place!! By far the best happy hour prices in the area and the food is always delicious!!
193,"This is a restaurant in a strip joint in Irving where there are quite a few lunch spots, I had to buy quick business lunch in the area and this place showed up on Yelp! As nearest with good ratings. The service was fast and good, food quality was good. Menu had almost all American versions of sushi rolls and most fried and grilled preparations of salmon and Tuna and regular steak thus keeping it quite Â diverse for Â business lunch attendees. If you are stuck in this area due to traffic I would recommend this spot for lunch. The place is little and dark for lunch ambiance but they turn tables fast and that's best for lunch."
194,"My husband and I just ate at this place for the first time this morning. We arrived there at 10:30AM ready for sushi! Right of the bat, the decor and ambiance was so calm and inviting. And the MUSIC, it was like Amy Winehouse Radio from Pandora.. I LOVED IT. Everything about the environment was great! Service was quick, professional, and friendly. As for the food, we were pleasantly surprised with the 4 sushi rolls we had. Coming from California, we are pretty picky when it comes to seafood. This restaurant definitely did not disappoint. We will be back!!!"
195,"Stopped in for an early Saturday lunch. The service was absolutely amazing. The waitress explained the menu, let us know the best drinks and dishes. They served American style brunch food which looked delicious (a server even stopped on his way to drop off food to another table as we looked at the menu to show us the dishes)... but we stopped in for sushi so we stuck with that. The food was great, and I highly recommend the flavored mimosas."
196,"This is my favorite sushi place! Everything my husband and I have had here is awesome. Since the first time I've tried this place, I've been back every week. And I've brought friends and coworker with me here. My favorite place to sit is at the sushi bar and chit chat with Nuke, one of the sushi bar chefs.I can't say much more than this place is absolutely amazing."
197,"Just have saturday lunch at this place. I ordered a spicy chicken bento box for $12. There is a lot of food, a miso soup, salad (not the normal ginger based dressing), spicy chicken, 2 shrimp tempura, a cucumber tempura, an onion tempura, 4 pieces of California roll and a wasabi mashed potato. I am a little sad that they didn't have the sweet potato tempura I like, and salad isn't the ginger dressing I like, but the wasabi mashed potatoe is really good. Overall it is a nice restaurant, the service is nice and the atmosphere is good."
198,"The bartender was full of energy, helpful and a great conversationalist. Service was on point at 6PM on a Monday. All that we ordered was the Little Katana and Little Katana 101. Both sicker than dogs all night and morning. Severe stomach cramps and some TMI stuff. We won't be coming back."
199,"I tried out this new establishment about a week ago. I thought it was right up there with Blue Fish in terms of quality and price. This is by no means cheap, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, my go to place for Sushi in the greater Dallas area is Tei Tei. The prices are really identical, but I feel like Tei Tei has better quality ingredients and the authenticity to back everything up. Let's be real though, this is Las Colinas , and given that fact it's a great spot to grab dinner or lunch. Especially given the competing venues in the general vicinity.I found the rolls to be very generous in piece count, while the Sashimi was not quite there so far as bang for your buck goes. The hot stone bowls are an absolute must try, and provide a unique choose your own destiny (Goosebumps books) type dining experience. The guest can customize the ingredients, and the texture by way of cooking time. Also I failed to realize that I had eaten at Little Katana before. In the Galleria mall right outside of Macy's. I always thought they deserved a bigger pad to showcase their spread.The service was top notch, and I had no complaints in that department. The interior is very clean, welcoming, and well laid out. The only negative here is the size of the 2 person tables. They are a touch dinky for their given purpose. I will absolutely make this a staple of my business lunch/dinner rotation."
200,Im only giving it 2 stars because of the customer service was great! So this is my first time here and it's literally 3 minutes from my job and I saw the reviews and pictures which were nice! So I decided to give it shot. I got the 2 for $10 rolls which was the shrimp tempura roll and California roll. There was a funky smell to it that I didn't like which kind of killed my appetite. But still decided to try them. Well I didn't like it . It's not all that I still prefer my sushi from BFF . Honestly I will never come back. I couldn't finish it . So yes it was the worst $10 bucks I've ever spent! & I love sushi. Ugh!
201,"I'm a long time fan of Little Katana, having been a patron at The Galleria's location for almost 2 decades. Their food is always fresh, flavorful, and gorgeous! As well, the service is usually top notch! Last night was my first visit to this new location that is so close to home. The food was promptly delivered and staff was attentive and friendly. We had the No Problem Sushi Roll, the Ahi Tuna stack, the Japanese Red Snapper sashimi, the shrimp and vegetable tempura, the wagyu beef on a hot stone, and the shrimp head sashimi. All of the food was delicious and skillfully crafted. The sushi chef had been a sushi professional for 7 years. They have Kirin and Sapporo as well as a line of craft beer. They have a good selection of Sake as well. I can't wait to go back and try different items! Â I also got cheesecake to take home, and I'm having that for a snack when I get home from work today!"
202,"I am confused by this place. Seems to be Korean owned so why not serve Korean food. Sushi is just ok, maybe as good as you might find at a grocery. There are too many excellent sushi places in Dallas to endure this."
203,Honestly the service here was horrible! I have never been treated so poorly before. The lady was in a hurry to get our order in and out in 15 minutes. She kept rushing us to order and to pay just when the food was out. We didn't even get refills on water and had to ask the manager. I didn't see our waitress except when she took our order and gave us our check asking us to pay it now. Her name was soonyoung or something like that. I am very upset at the way we were treated. We didn't even enjoy the food because it felt so rushed and hurried. The food was decent which saved this review but bad service is the biggest thing to lose stars. The sashimi were thick and good and their rolls were okay. Nothing too fabulous. I wouldn't go back here.
204,"Best sushi in the area, hands down!We got the Katana sushi & sashimi combo (size large) and it includes chef's choice of a specialty roll + 8 pieces of sushi + 16 pieces of sashimi. It was super fresh & cut very generously (nice thick pieces). The sashimi was very soft & melted on the tongue. I seriously recommend it!Also I can't stop gushing about the desserts, wow. We tried the Mango cheese cake (which is made in house) and it was sooo worth it. I googled it and discovered it was featured on the Dallas Observer in 2007 as the best cheesecake. It's rich & creamy, but has a nice cakey consistency to it. Hope that makes sense :)Also tried the Mochi ice cream in Mango & Green tea. Usually I'm all about green tea flavored things, but this time I fell in love with the mango mochi ice cream. The mochi was very soft and tasted fresh, unlike the ones you buy in asian supermarkets. Definitely worth it to try!Also not pictured: Wagyu hot stone appetizer and the Charming roll. Wagyu hot stone looked amazing, but we didn't know how to cook it :( We put all the beef on the stone at once, and it got stuck to the rock and burned. Next time we'll put one piece of beef on the hot stone at a time, for like 5 seconds on each side! That's all the time that's needed.Charming roll tastes amazing. Would recommend!"
205,"Had a delicious dinner with family. All the food was exquisite. We were a little disappointed by the service as the main arrived before the appetizer, and the appetizer was served before the soup. We were seated very close to the singer and the pianist (despite all the empty tables). It was a little annoying while ordering as we couldn't hear what the waitress was saying. The singer and the pianist gave a great performance, though."
206,Dude at the front did not let me sit at a table of 4 for some reason. I came with my friend and we wanted to sit at a table of 4 and he had an issue. He told me I can only sit at the table of 4 if I came w 3 more people. However there was 2 people sitting on one of their table of 4s. Literally wanted to try this place but the dude was so rude and started arguing. I feel racially targeted and will make sure not to send any of the muslim community to this location. If there was a 0 star thats what I would give him. Rude people and lying is an automatic no for me. I got up and left. Didnt even wanna eat there after that.
207,Starters were the Kalbi which was Â deliciously cooked. Yellowtail was thick sliced unlike other places with super thin amounts. Sake was expensive considering other places would have offered the same thing. However I must applaud the wide variety Katana roll and Katana 101 were delicious but not better than the typical rainbow dragon or spider rolls that I usually order. Service was great. Overall I enjoyed my experience
208,I really liked this place. The bar tender was very nice and fast to keep my glass full. I had some happy hour apps then a roll with no rice with yellow tail that he recommended. It was awesome!! The items are a bit pricey normal menu but they're worth it. I'll be back for sure.
209,"This was a nice but unexpected experience. They have all the F's: Friendly, Fantastic Food, Fresh, Fast, Fun, Fabulous and I could go on. I got a special roll with yellowtail inside and wrapped outside with more yellowtail. It was incredible! The sizzling dumpling soup was good but basic."
210,"Really outstanding food: excellent sushi, good, big food bowls, great selection of everything...and wonderful customer service!"
211,Great little date night spot if you don't want to leave the Las Colinas area. Â Excellent service and good drinks.My girlfriend and I were very much impressed with the ambiance and the decor. Â She was a big fan of the music selection.Food. Â Excellent sushi. Â Didn't expect to find such good sushi so close to home. Â Their menu consists of more traditional rolls and Japanese entrees. Â They even have ramen. Â I highly suggest the Lobster roll. Â Their tempura was also very well prepared and tasted very good.Priced about as much as a normal sushi place would be. Â A hidden gem in Las Colinas. Â My girlfriend and I will definitely be back when we're in the mood and don't want to have to drive into Dallas.
212,"I'm giving Little Katana 4/5 and not a 3/5 because the food is a little above average as far as taste and quality. However, they definitely make up for what the food is lacking with their customer service. It's a versatile space that you can go for lunch, dinner, with groups, or for a date, I really like that! The stone bowl is probably one of their best menu options that I have had, I'm not crazy about it but it was good."
213,"Been here twice in the last couple weeks and have been meaning to write a review. Little Katana is simply amazing. Everything I have had there has been tasty and the presentation of the food is generally very nice as well. The Tonkotsu is some of the best I have had in DFW 9./10. Wagyu beef was very good as well. I'd give it a 8.5/10. I've had spicy tuna roll, dragon roll, spicy salmon roll, and I think the special dragon roll (can't quite remember the exact name) all of which have been fresh and tasty with very good texture 8.5/10. Best yet, I have always received A+ service here. It is definitely going to become a staple restaurant for myself."
214,The sushi was amazing. The sashimi was so Â fresh and melted in your mouth. Everything was awesome. When I come to Las Colinas for work I usually go to blue fish but decided to try something new. I am so glad I did! Now I have two sushi choices nearby the hotel
215,Great find! Smallish in size that i would call it an intimate setting. Nicely decorated and the staff was very friendly. My hotel is near the airport and there isn't anything close by. Found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It was a little difficult to find as it doesn't face the main road but the shuttle driver drove around until he found out. I'm so glad he did! I had the Tuna Poke and a Charming Roll. Delicious! The TP had a little heat to it but it didn't distract from the dish. The Charming Roll was so light but very filling.
216,"SUCH GOOD SUSHI!! We eat a lot of sushi but this is the best. The flavors are genius in the fire roll and white dragon roll, but their simple yellowtail and spicy tuna were just as delicious. The Happy Hour is an awesome deal, half price for pretty much all drinks -- and their lemongrass-infused Mule was perfect with sushi. Plus, the waitstaff gave us friendly and quick service. What a wonderful dinner, we'll be back right away :)"
217,"I have ordered here about 10 times, mostly sushi. The food is always fresh. The order is always correct and the staff is very kind. Pricing is appropriate. I enjoy eating at the restaurant as well. The atmosphere is romantic and enjoyable."
218,"I don't like sushi so I'm just going to put that out there I did not eat the sushi, their prices are amazing during lunch their food was also soo good. I just loved this place, I came at 11 and it wasn't crowded at all but it was getting there when I left. Service was amazing!! I just like this place a lot. Its also really clean, my lunch buddy said her sushi was pretty good also."
219,"Fantastic sushi! Great ambiance and classy decor. High top tables, low top tables and sushi bar are you available seating choices. Friendly staff. Every detail was thought out! It is PRICEY and I haven't seen a happy hour for food/drinks advertised here which are the only two things I'd like to see change."
220,"All of the food I got here was absolutely impeccable. Came here for lunch on a Friday at 1 pm, restaurant was about half full so I was glad we missed the rush. However, whenever we needed a waiter/waitress there never seemed to be one around. For the amount of people there and the number of waitresses/ waiters, it didn't make sense why we had to wait so long for 1) our orders to be taken 2)our waters to be refilled 3)them to give us our checks. Other than that, the food was delicious, I will definitely be back with higher hopes of better customer service."
221,"I'm not sure if I reviewed Little Katana before... if so, consider this an addition, if not, here it goes:1. Â The restaurant is pleasing in their decor, lighting, etc. Â When you enter you see the whole restaurant (bar, tables and Sushi bar) and can sense the whole restaurant... nice looking. Â Something I have noticed in many reviews is people mentioning ""clean"" in the restaurant... Â That isn't usually one of the things I am especially looking for...however, if the place is not ""clean"" I notice that real quick. Let me see...food, cleanliness, aahh, yup I'm on the band-wagon on the ""clean"" these days and especially so in a Sushi restaurant. Â This restaurant passes!2. Â On arrival you are always greeted and welcomed while being seated. Â No lag time when we have visited 4-5 times now.3. Â We've usually been greeted by our server shortly after seating. Â Our server's have mostly been good... we had one woman - I think our 1st visit who wasn't up to par - don't see her any longer? Â Other servers have been quite good. Â The other night we left a 20% gratuity - don't do that unless the server is really good. Â Plus, when he wasn't there, a lovely Asian woman jumped right in to help / serve us. Â She was awesome too... Â She did something ""very smart service-wise and it was also quite thoughtful"". Â Yay, good service!!!4. Â Menu... Â We have enjoyed our food... appetizers, Sushi presented well and fresh looking and tasting. Â They have an interesting menu, lots of choices without offering 1,000 things. Â We had Sushi, Seafood Udon, Gyoza, Hamachi Kama - which was A) delicious Â  B) a very good size portion Â C) well priced - not free, not cheap, but a fair price for the good size, well cooked, etc., nice item. Â My menu complaint is that they do not offer Bento boxes at dinner... why???5. Â I did notice the former owner of Hanasho at their Sushi Bar and thought that was odd until I learned Hanasho had closed. Â I also noticed the exec. chef around... Â The VP of their parent company, a mature Japanese gentleman, came by our table and he also bid us good night.So, we like Little Katana and it's become our go-to place for Sushi in our neighborhood. Â Keep up the quality Katana and we're back time and again."
222,This is one of my fav spots for sushi!! Way better than Blue Fish!! Their food has never disappointed me. Highly recommend!!
223,"Meh alright. Definitely have had better sushi. I came here for lunch. It was decently priced. I got the avocado egg rolls which were delicious but small. I also go the chicken soup, but it had very minimal broth so I was disappointed. I got the salmon teriyaki bento box. The salmon was delicious, the sushi was subpar. The salad was weedy. The tempura was tasty. Service was not that great either and the restaurant was empty. I'd be interested to come here again for dinner to see why it's earned so many stars."
224,"Best dining experience in a while! Great service, amazing food, and live music. We had the wagging Hot Rock appetizer, Seafood Stone Bowl, and Katana 101Roll. For dessert we had flourless chocolate cake, and bread putting with the red bean ice cream. Everything was amazing. I will order the same thing next time!"
225,We are excited to hear that Chef Yuji Suzuki from Hanasho is now at this Little Katana location.Hansho has closed after a wonderful run.Chef Yuji Suzuki is now at Little Katana Las Colinas! Please support Chef Suzuki by visting Little Katana Las Colinas!
226,We enjoyed our first trip to this restaurant and I also went with friends. Â The staff was extra eager to get us whatever we needed. Â Maybe they were slightly too eager and that's why I'm not giving it a five star but it certainly was enjoyable.My wife had the tenderloin and for the price it was a decent size portion. I had a bowl of their Korean style beef.
227,"This place had great reviews and did not disappoint! Our waitress was so sweet and attentive, very professional. The sushi was delicious and the restaurant was very classy! 10/10 would go again! The angel roll doesn't have rice it was wrapped in cucumber and was really delicious. We had two other rolls that were great and the half off sake Monday was pretty sweet for dessert. Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy go here"
228,"I searched restaurant options for an hour before deciding on Little Katana while visiting Dallas/Irving for work. I chose it specifically because I was in the mood for sea bass. I am SO glad I did. Best meal and service I've had the pleasure of enjoying in quite some time. The flavors danced on my palate - from the sea bass with roasted veggies and wasabi mashed potatoes, to the ginger vanilla creme brulee - it was a beautiful meal! The quality of the experience could've demanded a much higher cost, but I found the pricing to be very reasonable. This will be my first stop the next time I'm in town."
229,Great sushi and service. Â Special Dragon Roll was awesome. Â I was also very happy to find that they had Yamazaki wiskey. Â We will definitely be coming back soon.
230,great sushi- large and fresh fish! will get again
231,"Just had an excellent dinner here with the family. Half of us are vegetarian. We got the avocado roll, veggie roll, the yakisoba noodles, and the hot stone rice bowl. Favorites were the avo roll (which they made from scratch for us without the sun dried tomato, which we didn't care for) and the hot stone rice bowl. The noodles were just okay. The non-vegetarians' favorites were the jalapeÃ±o poppers and the orange ginger salmon. Our waitress was incredibly friendly as well."
232,"This place is amazing! The staff is so nice and accommodating, food is excellent and the quality of fish is great. The jalapeÃ±o poppers are to die for, check out the Charming Roll. I'm definitely a regular here."
233,Stopped in randomly and glad I did! Fish was so fresh and the staff was so friendly! I will definitely be back!
234,"I was skeptical at first that a strip mall sushi place but have the ambience I was looking for. Boy was I wrong. It was a great happy hour and while a limited selection of craft beers, a great bartender who knew what she was doing and the Deep Ellum IPA was all I needed. The sushi was equally fresh and tasty. Rarely am I impressed with sushi bars in their ability to create some happy hour ambience. Normally I feel like I'm just there to eat sushi and that's it, but I had a great time T the bar with an interesting local crowd. Definitely would come back here again."
235,"I was a huge fan if this place. Went at least once a week from the time it opened in Irving Â Until I nearly choked to death on a piece of fish with skin and gross stuff on it that was in my Â sushi. Â I ran to bathroom Â trying to choke it up. Â Had to put my finger in my throat to throw up. Â Threw up just in time. Â I thought I was going to die. Â I told the manager and he gave me a 10% discount even though I hadn't eaten but the one bite that choked me! Â I would NEVER RECOMMEND EATING Â HERE! Â  Never back. Â Couldn't believe how they treated me with total disregard. Â I was a frequent Customer, but that shouldn't have mattered. Â I couldn't Â bye believe they didn't care I had nearly choked to death getting that chunk of fish and skin Â out off my throat. Â I even called and left them a message telling them again what happened and left my phone number but never received a call back. Â DON'T risk it. Â Don't go!"
236,This place was a real surprise. Â The Shanghai noodles were tasty and the thick noodles were a treat and had a bunch of good seafood. Â I did end up with a messy shirt from slurping the noodles. Â The maguro was fresh and the cut was generous.
237,"I visited this restaurant twice with friends for dinner. Â Price and quality is not bad for the dinner, nice ambience and display. Today I ordered a take out from their lunch menu. I got a oyster mushroom tofu soup for 8 dollars plus I tipped. It was a small bowl of soup, 2/3 of the way full. Nothing came with it, not even a small bowl of rice. Â For spending close to $10 for lunch it was very disappointing. Â Soup was good but I suggest Fast and furious across the street is way better for lunch or even Wholefoods."
238,Love the sushi here!!! So glad I found this place. I will be back and when I do I will be bringing friends with me!
239,"We sat at our table for 10-15 minutes but a waiter never came, so we left. Not even someone saying ""I'll be with you soon."" Multiple waiters went past us multiple times each but not one even paid attention to us. We saw another couple had the same problem and they went up to the guy who was seating people and complained to him. Pretty bad to not even serve customers. This was 7:30 on a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't even full, we were seated immediately after walking in. This was on 6/1 I believe. I was very disappointed as I had heard so many great things about this place and had anticipated trying it for a long time. We ended up eating a different sushi place. One star can be given for the very nice decor and live music they had."
240,Pricey for a strip mall in Irving but food and service was very good.
241,"The food was great, service excellent, atmosphere cozy & pleasant. Family friendly yet could be very special for a date night too."
242,"Never thought I would find something like this in Irving, but definitely an unforgettable experience here. Sat at the sushi bar and the Sushi Chef Nuke prepared us the most amazing meal."
243,"Delicious food and superb service. My server Akemi was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the avocado rolls which came out piping hot and perfect. I also go the hot stone bowl with combo meat (chicken, beef & shrimp). I ate way too much because I just kept wanting one more bite. The room is lovely as well with plenty of seating and a full bar."
244,"This is my first time visiting. I ended up going with the seaweed salad and spicy tuna (as usual). It was ok. I asked my spicy mayo but they didn't give much. Also, their spicy mayo isn't that good. It was edible, but not that good."
245,"It all started with a great ambience, warm greetings, and all the attention I received at Little Katana. A wide variety of Japanese cuisines, warm Saki, oyster shooters, and exceptional service made it a great experience.They also have a great Ramen selection."
246,"What drew me in was their menu because I love sushi and Chilean sea bass. I'm from CA so I wasn't sure what to expect from a TX sushi restaurant but was pleasantly surprised by their food. We ordered the Chilean sea bass (pretty good), the Charming roll (would order again), and the Special Dragon roll (it was OK). It was a cute little restaurant with great service. I would go back the next time I'm in Dallas and staying at the Hyatt House"
247,Little Katana is consistently excellent quality sushi and customer service. Â We've been going here for a couple years now and they still far outshine the competition. Â Highly recommend Â Little Katana if you're looking for great sushi!
248,"Great tasting shuhi, tastes and smells fresh. Good atmosphere and great interior design, however it is a little dark. The shuhi has good flavor"
249,Not high quality fish used. Same prices as high end sushi but not even near the quality levels. Service is alright but you'll find here rolls with tons of sauce and fried vs fresh. Better off going elsewhere.
250,"Love this place! I go two or three times a month. Their sushi is fresh, their appetizers are delicious and their hot stone bowls are sooooo good. I've had the crap stuffed jalapeÃ±os, all types of sushi and their chicken stone bowl, and they never disappoint me. The staff is attentive and the environment is very welcoming. If you're looking for some good food, i highly recommended this restaurant!"
251,"This was our favorite place in Irving. Everything tasted great, my favorites are Ahi Tower and Katana 101 roll. All of the waiters are good and friendly."
252,Got a sushi roll w/ the piece of wasabi in it. Other sushi rolls were boring as well. Overall not a good experience.
253,"The katana roll and jalapeÃ±o poppers were delicious, it wasn't to spicy and very flavorful. What made the experience better was the waitress and host, they were so sweet. Great customer service"
254,"This is my favorite place to go for sushi. I never order off the menu. I tell Nuke what I'm craving and he creates the most amazing tasting food. Nuke does an awesome job educating and keeping you laughing while preparing your food. The staff, atmosphere and experience keep me coming back."
255,"I had the fire roll and filet mignon, the sushi was delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly. The server was really attentive, without being a hover-er, and the live band was great. It was really nice to eat to some nice acoustic music. Little Katana will be one of my regulars when I'm in town."
256,"Visiting the area because we need to fly out of Dallas instead of Houston due to Hurricane Harvey. Read the reviews and was intrigued. My husband, teenage daughter and I all had the Omakase which is a chef's choice menu. It was amazing - baby octopus appetizer, several sashimi selections, sushi, spicy scallop and tuna and a grand finale unit shooter. All delicious and prepared by Nuke, their phenomenal sushi chef. Highly recommend."
257,This was my first experience with ramen and it was delicious. I had the pork bone broth. We also had the sizzling dumplings and shrimp tempura Sushi. He had the combo fried rice. Everything was so good!! Would love to come come back one day.
258,Had lunch here on a Thursday at 12:30. There was a decent crowd but we were seated and helped immediately. The food and service was excellent. It is a little pricey for lunch but I believe it's appropriately priced for the quality.
259,Nuk is a 12 on a 10 point scale. Service is impeccable. Drinks fantastic. Sushi served with a reverence for the craft. Nuk is an artist. Â Do not miss! Holly is the best server. She will deliver the meal of your dreams. Go for it.
260,"Amazing sushi and service. I was scared when the one in Dallas closed, but I will be dining at the new location often. Loved it. The crab dynamite, Louisiana roll, and blue crab rolls were out of control good!"
261,"Was a table of 4, service was good but sushi was NOT fresh. Ordered a No problem roll, spider roll, Mama roll, Avocado roll, Â cajun roll, and Ahi tower. As I got my order I could tell the crab meat was not fresh and looked to be an imintation of crab. So i asked my server if the crab meat was fresh and she told me no it wasnt and it would be a up charge for real crab meat. We also asked for a side of real wasabi and, the waitress told us it would be a also a up charge of $3.00 and then given wasabi paste instead."
262,"Great food, Great Service! Ate at the Sushi bar. Nuke was my Sushi Chef, and he was awesome! Had a wonderful time, thanks Nuke!"
263,Very good service and the fish is of very high quality. They have really done a great job with the menu. The vibe is amazing when with live music in the evenings.
264,"I have been here multiple times now and every time I go the service is fantastic and the food is even better. Holly is always very nice and attentive to make sure we are taken care of. We sat at the sushi bar this past time and Nuke, the sushi chef, was great. He made a specialty roll and was constantly making sure we were satisfied. The manager has been out on the floor each time making sure everyone is happy. We will continue to come back!!"
265,I was never a sushi fan but I am a fan now. All thanks to Little Katana. It's a good up market restaurant with good crowd around. Out and out a niche place. Do try the shrimp tempura. It's a thumbs up from end side. Adios
266,"I came here for a date night dinner one Friday evening, and will certainly be back if I'm ever in the area and looking for sushi..PROS:-Great happy hour that doesn't end until about 7. I was able to get three really delicious cocktails for $5 each, and if we'd wanted some appetizers, those prices were fantastic too,-The sushi menu is pretty extensive and more than reasonably priced. We got four different rolls for under $40.-The staff were friendly and attentive. I took home some leftovers, and as I was looking for my waitress to ask for some to go chopsticks, a man who looked like the owner got up from his seat to come ask what I needed. He then proceeded to very sweetly not only get me the chopsticks but also bagged my food with additional soy sauce packets.-There's a piano player and one of the staff members sang some beautiful Christmas songs during our dinner. It was a really nice touch.CONS:-The menus and our tablecloth had some stains on them which isn't a big deal, it just took a little from the ambiance of an otherwise great restaurant."
267,"We were looking for a new sushi place and tried this today for lunch.My friend and I both ordered the spicy tuna (poke) bowls and were wowed by the portions and quality. Â The lunch special included a starter of rich miso soup, which hit the spot. Â The tuna bowl included rice, crab, spicy tuna, avocado, seaweed salad and spicy mayo drizzle.I can't wait to return!"
268,Crawfish dynamite and lobster dynamite were amazing! Service was great as well. Will definitely be back soon!
269,"I came here while visiting the area for work. Â The interior of the place is nice, quiet, lots of seating. Â Since it was just me, I got sat at the sushi bar. Â Nuke was the chef and advised me to get the chef's special. Â  Sooo glad I did. Â The food was all amazing, and getting to talk with Nuke was awesome too. Â I highly recommend coming here if you're in the area. Â The entire staff was friendly and accommodating too. Â I'd return for sure."
270,Great little jewel in Las Colinas! I'm not a sushi fan but LOVE the Japanese fried rice with chicken. Very fresh ingredients. They happy hour has EXCELLENT prices! I absolutely enjoy the $2 Community draft beers during this time. All of the wait staff are knowledgeable and super nice!!! You MUST try this quaint little hidden jewel. You will not be disappointed
271,"I was in town for work and craving some sushi. I'm so glad I came here. Sat at the sushi bar, and their new sushi chef, Nuke, took care of me. I wasn't sure what to get but was up for anything so he pulled together a lovely sashimi plate with a variety of 5 different types of fish, 2 pieces each, and of generous sizes. The presentation was gorgeous. Then he made me a special role for the day that was perfectly balanced between sweet and heat and smooth and crunchy. Delicious meal overall. And the staff was quite pleasant. I highly recommend you stop by!"
272,The service is impeccable! Very traditional; pour your cold sake for you the moment it is low! A sushi was so fresh. Â The salmon belly is out of this world!
273,"Can I just say how excited I was to learn Little Katana was coming to Las Colinas!?!? Not only do they have incredible service, but the food is always excellent. I've had an amazing experience here every time. They are quick and efficient with To-Go orders, too. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. (Try the Salmon Tower and the Hot Stone Seafood Bowl...incredible!)Side note: We came in today and chatted over lunch for two hours. Never once did they make us feel rushed. Even after we paid the bill, our waitress still refilled drinks and kept an eye on us. Great service!"
274,Server Estella was amazing!!! She recommended the best rolls and appetizers on the menu and the food was amazing. The katana roll and the katana 101 were the best rolls I've ever had! Definitely will be back if I'm ever in the area!! My first time and def won't be my last time. Thanks for making my first experience there a unforgettable one!
275,"Delicious. Excellent service. We came without a reservation and were seated right away. The sushi was beautifully presented. Our waitress was awesome. The owner was around to greet us and check in with us, was super friendly and even walked us out the door once we left."
276,"Just arrived to the Irving area and have been trying a lot of different places. Came here this afternoon for lunch and was told they only do brunch on Saturdays. Decided to stick around, best decision of my life. Ordered pot stickers 10/10, and the 2 for $10 sushi roll (spicy California and shrimp tempura), all of the food was enough for my wife and I. We also got mimosas 10/10 for $2 each. The bill came out to $22.73. The quality of the food was something you would expect to find in a much more expensive restaurant and the servers and staff were very polite. If you're looking for a great atmosphere and even better food this is your place!"
277,"Awesome experience. Literally everything was perfect about dinner tonight from the hot stones and sizzling dumplings, to the sushi rolls and dessert. We had great service and drinks as well. I recommend everyone check this place for a quiet but nice date night."
278,"This was my first time coming here. It was my birthday and so I had decided to try some place new and different from the usual Italian we do. Everyone was so happy that I chose this place. I don't eat sushi but they had other options which was really nice. Everyone was happy with what they had ordered. The service was good and staff was friendly. They were so nice that they gave us samples of wine to try before we ordered the bottle. I am very picky and like sweet ones and the waitress suggested us one that was perfect for my taste. I believe it was the owner who had come up to me and spoke to me while I was waiting on the rest of my group to show up so I didn't feel alone sitting at a table with 11 empty chairs. Â The icing on the cake was when I was surprised with a mango cheesecake with a candle on it. I really didn't expect them to do that and felt really special. The entire table was delighted as well and felt very appreciative of the hospitality we received. Â We will definitely be back again. By the way, that mango cheesecake was AMAZING!! (I am not a fan of mango) Must give it a try!"
279,Everything was so good. Nice little place with great ambiance. Sushi came out quickly as well. Will definitely return next time in area
280,Wanted to try Blue Fish because they are about to open one near us! The food is excellent and our server Michael was the best! Can't wait to eat at Blue Fish again!
281,This is the best Asian restaurant around this area! I especially like their dumping and bento box. The hot stone bowl fried rice is great too!
282,I love the location out in my neighborhood (Knox Henderson) glad they opened this location for my business lunches!
283,In Dallas ( Las Colinas) area this place rocks!! Probably the best sushi place I have been in a long time. You can taste the freshness which is important. The servers are amazing and display the true Japanese culture. The Lobster roll was amazing and I will definitely be back. Enjoy
284,"First time here! We come to the Dallas area twice a year for the Gift Market and decided to try something new. Fish was fresh and delicious in the sushi, orange ginger salmon was really good, loved the wasabi mashed potatoes. Dessert was chocolate torte that we couldn't finish. Overall a great experience. Service was excellent - friendly and attentive without being too invasive."
285,"I dined here with a co worker while in town this week, I ordered the hot stone bowl with bee,chicken and shrimp, Â it was absolutely delicious. Â The right amount of spice and fresh chopped veggies made this an excellent choice. The server chops all the ingredients in front of you and then serves in a round super hot bowl at the teable which cooks the Â ingredients . I ate every last morsel in the bowl. My colleague had the avocado roll with salmon, it was excellent too. Service was quick and efficient and I'll be back time I'm in the area"
286,"Ambiance, service and quality! Generally you are lucky if you can find two of these three at a Dallas sushi restaurant but this place hit the trifecta. I will definitely be back soon."
287,I've been looking for a good lunch sushi option close to my new job and decided to stop in here....i will definitely be back! Probably the best tasting/quality salmon I've had in a long time! I have food allergies so it's always a concern to make sure adjustments are made and the food came out perfectly the first time. The staff is super friendly and very responsive. Atmosphere is warm and bright without being too stark or gloomy. I'll have to come back after work and try out the full bar!
288,They are always consistently good. The sushi always feels fresh and super tasty. Their ramen is outstanding too.
289,"Good sushi. Reasonably priced. Good ahi tower. The piano player was too loud, made conversation difficult. And I don't understand why they had a bright light shining on him."
290,"Quick friendly service. The sushi came out very fast. I had a kataniniti I believe it was, It was good and sweet. Happy hour has 2 for $8 rolls. 5 dollar calamari. Not bad."
291,Not that good for the price. There are quite a few sushi places that are much better for less
292,"Hands down, the BEST sushi restaurant in Irving. Sit at the the sushi bar and ask for Nuke. He is so friendly and is a phenomenal sushi chef. Ask for the Snow Mountain Roll or be lucky enough to get an special off the menu roll!"
293,"One of the better sushi experiences in the dfw area. Traditional in there approach for the most part. We had premium service from the sushi master Nuke. Too bad we were pressed for time, so we couldn't enjoy ourselves longer. Will have to come back again to see what else they have to offer. Four stars, unfortunately for Little Katana, I've been spoiled due to my time spent in California and Asia."
294,"This was my favorite restaurant to pick up my bento box for lunch. I've been going about a year and always substitute the California roll for my spicy tuna roll, I always pay an up charge, it's never been a problem. Today, while en route to the restaurant, I call in to place the order and am rudely told they no longer do substitutions, the lady can't tell me when this has changed and offers no substitution for this one time for a repeat, loyal customer. Since I'm basically there, I go in anyway to place the order, there is a gentleman at the door who helps me. I order my usual with the substitution he tells me the same thing. Rather than offering me my substitution this one time (since this is news to me they no longer take substations), he, who turns out to be the manager, would rather lose my business than fill my order this one time. I've brought customers, coworkers, etc to this restaurant, after today you've lost a customer forever. Horrible customer service, I'm very disappointed."
295,I went there during happy hour so I only tried items on that menu. But the prices were pretty good. 8$ for 2 sushi rolls. Less than 5$ appetizers! I tried Takayuki for the first time here and it was pretty amazing. Sushi rolls were good. Nothing extraordinary. Service was awesome! Waiters were very nice. Decor of the place is really cute and chic! It's a good date spot!
296,"Nice atmosphere with black table cloth and a piano in the back corner of the restaurant. Â Happy hour price was $4 each for spicy tuna roll and tempura roll. Â $2 Schilling Ale and hot sake. Â Hamachi nigiri $6 Albacore Tuna $5. Â The rolls were average, nothing special. Â I guess that's what you get for $4. Â But the quality of the hamachi and albacore were definitely below average. Â They were not tender at all."
297,"This is by far the best sushi I've had since moving here 8 months ago! I loved every roll that we ordered. Â I tried the Crawfish Dynamite, Louisiana, Yellow fish, and Katana 101 Roll."
298,"Delicious takeout order of spicy tuna roll, miso soup and steamed shrimp dumplings. My only recommendation is to provide a larger spoon (for takeout orders) for the miso soup."
299,"Cute little place. The food was good - I don't have any complaints there. They have a server/bartender there - her hair is dyed fun colors. I was only going to give this place 4 stars but I remembered her and how great she was, so the 5th star is just for her. She was super nice and convinced me to try a drink she just created. I loved it! Normally I'm iffy about trying new drinks, but she asked me questions and suggested her new creation and it was exactly what I like."
300,My husband and I waited literally till last minute on New Years eve to pick up some food. We decided on sushi. Little Katana's was the last place open in our area so we decided to stop by. We picked up a few rolls to ring in the new year and they were so yummy and decently priced. Definitely recommend!
301,"All around, highly recommend this place. Today was a particularly stressful morning at work, and then I stumbled upon this new restaurant. Grace, the server, so pleasant and nice, I like the black table cloths even at lunch, the meal was delicious (had a ramen bowl + sushi roll), and if I lived here I would definitely come back to try more because their quality of fish looks really good. Thanks for the great lunch and the reset button to today!"
302,"Stopped here for an early dinner after reading some great reviews. Â We ordered the Sizzling Dumplings for an appetizer followed by the Charming Roll, Dragon Roll, and the No Problem roll. Â Out of the three rolls, the No Problem was the best choice. Â I didn't really enjoy the Charming or Dragon roll because of the rich mayo sauce and that may just be an acquired taste. Â We passed on dessert. Â The waitress that took care of us was prompt and attentive - great experience."
303,Great new place for sushi! The service and food has been outstanding during my three visits so far.
304,This is the second time we've tried this place and another disappointment. It looked like the place was understaffed. The service could have been way better than this. Not coming back again.
305,"I used to actually serve here so I know the process of how they make their dishes. It's delicious because most of their plates are made in house from scratch. We ordered their hot stone bowl and their katana sampler plate. Their dumplings are so soft, crispy, and full of flavor. Their calamari has a delicate balance of fried, soft, and chewy. Their stone bowl is perfectly well cooked rice and veggies and juicy pieces of shrimp. Katana has my favorite salmon roe sushi. Their mama roll didnt last long on the table. it's soft sesame salmon flesh deliciously surrounds carrot avocado and crabmeat mix. We also ordered their mango cheesecake and chocolate tort. Both desserts were densely packed with individual flavor and moisture. The cheesecake is made from scratch and has layers of mangochunks, whipped cream, and cinnamon pie crust. The Choco tort is rich and comparable to Choco fudge and is drizzled with raspberry sauce. Love this place, especially ever since they lowered some of their prices!"
306,"Second time here. Always a nice vibe sometimes even with live music. Always has the top football game on, no sound but still nice."
307,"Favorite sushi in the area! Their calamari is light and fresh, as well as their sashimi. The speciality fire and torch rolls were amazing! Ended dinner with the mango cheesecake which was OMG TO DIE FOR SO GOOD!!!!!Will be coming back again soon! Thuy was a great server and manager Casey was VERY welcoming :)"
308,"One of the best happy hours I've been to!! Happy hour food was amazing, half bottles of wine on Wednesday and Saturday, and the sushi/seafood Singapore noodles were fantastic! Highly recommended! Will definitely be back!!"
309,"Love this place! Great sushi, great atmosphere, and the service was impeccable."
310,Great service! Wonderful food! We got the sunny roll and it was amazing. Would recommend this place and will eat here again if we are in town.
311,"We moved from Houston, the culinary city of Texas, to Dallas and were looking for a good place to eat sushi. We ended Yelping sushi and Little Katana came up with highly favorable reviews. Let me say that we're glad we came here. The girlfriend and I were impressed with the attentive staff, the very fresh sushi, and amazing texture of their food. The icing on the cake was when they ran out of banana pudding. I was sad, ""Aaw"" but then instead gave us extra green mochi for free ""Yay!"" Great environment and fantastic food! Do yourself a favor and visit this place if you're in the Las Colinas area."
312,We're from California and were having a hard time finding a high quality sushi place in Irving. We happened to try this spot and it was awesome!!! Â By far the best sushi we've had in DFW. High quality fresh fish and excellent service. We will be regulars!
313,"This place is great! The service was excellent. The food was exceptional. We had the chicken & waffles during the Saturday brunch. The chicken was seasoned wonderfully. The waffles were delicious. The mimosa were tasty! I highly recommend this spot. It is small, yet quaint and trendy. Very clean."
314,"This is a nice alternative for sushi, if you get tired of Blue Fish down the street. Service was good and the sushi is excellent. Their 2 for 10 sushi roll deal is very filling and they also offer a good variety of bento boxes, ramen and rice bowls. Will definitely come back."
315,BEST Sushi!!! Â Sat at the Sushi Bar and visited with Chef Neuk. Â Awesome Chef and so creative! Â Sushi was FRESH! Â This is now my favorite place to go. Â Wish I knew how to post pics!
316,"Good luck finding Poke bowls in the DFW area - so I thought I would try a few Japanese/Sushi houses. This was a real winner. Yellowtail appetizer (wish fresh jalapeÃ±os) was fresh, sizable and very flavorful. Sushi was also fresh but try the brussel sprouts salad. Â Incredible. Another great restaurant in my DFW rotation."
317,Great quiet little place for a date. Â Found this place on accident. Â Good food and great hospitality.
318,"This is an excellent sushi/ramen house located in an area that sorely needed a quality Japanese place. Â  The food is great, and service is top notch."
319,"Last night was my first time at little Katana. The ambiance was nice. Â As for the food, Â the hot stone seafood bowl was delicious and very filling. Â I will definitely be back!!!!!"
320,The best Japanese in town the best food and the service is also the best. My wife and I made this our go to Japanese restaurant.
321,I have been to the best sushi restaurants on both coasts and this one ranks one of the best and in Dallas Texas! Who would believe that. The Akashi beef appetizer on hot stone was phenomenal as were there rolls and mango cheesecake. The service is 5 star. Impeccable!
322,"If you're in the mood for sushi, do yourself a favor & go here. We were our for our 21st anniversary. We initially had planned on going to Nobu. We decided we really just wanted a place that's more relaxed. After reading the reviews we opted for Little Katana. Don't let the fact that this gem is in a strip center deter you. Once you walk through the door, you will be pleased. We were immediately greeted & sat down. Our server Ashley was fantastic. She was attentive, explained the menu very well, & really takes pride in her job. The food was exceptional. We ordered from the hot menu as well as sushi. The sea bass sushi was fresh from the Japanese market & it melted in my mouth. The rolls were fresh & presented beautifully. We went on a Saturday night & they had live music (easy listening tunes that most will recognize). Â It was loud enough to enjoy but still easily able to carry on a conversation. Â They have 1/2 priced bottles of wine & saki on Saturday's. The manager (perhaps owner) stopped by several times to check on us & he was pleasant. We will definitely return. I wish Little Katana would come to Fort Worth. The ambience is perfect for a lovely dinner & the price point is great as well."
323,"Really good happy hour sushi! Very attentive staff , great place to relax after work!"
324,"My husband and I went on a Friday night and it was perfect! Â The moment you walk in the dÃ©cor and the atmosphere is perfect! Â The clean shinning glasses on the table with BLACK tablecloths and napkins, perfect, are lovely! Â So clean and the music is awesome. Just the right mix of tunes and the volume is perfect. Â  SERVICE is top notch. Â Very attentive and helpful. Â Just a perfect evening. Â FOOD was amazing. Â The Broccoli and Kale appetizer was wonderful and so pretty as well. Â It was almost like lightly fried chips stacked on a lovely plate with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar glaze. Â ASK for it! Â  The desserts are made in house daily! Â Don't skip that part. Â Mango Cheesecake was perfect and out of the ordinary. Â YOU must go. Â IT is worth the trip.So glad they are in Irving!Ms. Douget"
325,"Great service, great food. Love their extended hours, you barely can find a restaurant open this late in las colinas."
326,I've been eating sushi for many years and this is the best I've had. I asked Nuke to fix me up as opposed to ordering off of the menu. He rolled out a series of things that I can't describe. Do yourself a favor and go to Little Katana and ask for him to do the same. It will be the best sushi/sashimi experience of your life.
327,Great food. Sit at the sushi bar and introduce yourself to the chefs. Nuke is legit. Â Let him pick your menu and ask for what is not on the menu.
328,Excellent sushi! Â What a nice surprise. Â Saturday night music was absolutely perfect with top notch sushi at a very reasonable price. Â Definitely coming back here!
329,Little Katana was amazing! We came in at 3:30 on a Saturday and we were the only ones there. The service was great! We will be coming back.
330,"Great sushi restaurant! Fast and friendly service. Nice ambience..Has kids menu. Ordered 3 rolls- mama roll, katana roll and crab dynamite. All very good. Ended up with mango cheesecake- must try! Will definitely come back and try the other entrees."
331,"Just visiting Dallas and found this place on Yelp reviews were great so we came to see how it was. Pleasantly surprised by absolutely great, very attentive service from Myra. Manager Daniel was very attentive and courteous asking about and ensuring our satisfaction. Great food great place."
332,Excellent service and the quality of the food was superb. Nice wine list and a great happy hour.
333,Amazing place! The best Asian food I have taste around here and the people is so nice! The food taste is unbelievable and prices are very good as well! Highly recommended!
334,"Excellent sushi, lovely atmosphere, perfect cocktails! Yellow tail sushi, perhaps called nigiri in other restaurants, was a huge hit. The red bean ice cream bread pudding was the perfect ending to our meal."
335,"So good. Â Sit at the bar and let the chef, Nuke, take care of you. Â  His style is a great mix if contemporary and traditional and really seems to enjoy taking care of the customers. Â  Entertaining and absolutely delicious. Â  This is definitely in the rotation now when I come to town for work. Â  Thanks Nuke"
336,"Let the chef, Nuke, Â build your meal. Give him free reign and your mind will be blown. Incredible experience!!!"
337,"Ate here two weekends ago and sat at the sushi bar. It was a relatively slow night, and Nuke recommended that we go off menu and let him create a chef's tasting. We started out with an Edo-style sushi tasting. Everything was phenomenally fresh, and the subtle changes that Nuke made to an otherwise very traditional tasting gave each piece his own signature uniqueness. After, we had two hand rolls and a specialty roll - both of which were outstanding. In sum, one of the best sushi meals I've had in Texas, and Nuke's Edo-style tasting rivaled the same experience in Tsukiji market in Tokyo. I can safely say that I will be back."
338,"As several of the more recent reviews suggest, one of Little Katana's newest Sushi Chefs Nuk has definitely up-leveled the Sushi! I'd been here for Dinner a couple of times previously and Nuk's dishes were definitely a notch above what I've experienced previously. Standouts included the Uni shooter and the marinated/smoked Yellowtail. Do yourself a favor and sit at the Sushi bar when Nuk is there, he will keep me coming back for sure."
339,"We loved this place until today! One of our coworkers had tuna sushi. Â As soon as he bit into it he tasted something like hand sanitizer and it was as burning his mouth. Â He told the waitress he wasn't looking for a discount he just wanted them to know their tuna had some kind of chemicals on it. Â She came back to the table and said that the tuna was fresh and it just must have too much mercury in it. Â You can't see, smell or taste mercury. Â It was a chemical. Â We won't be going back!"
340,Extremely fresh and delicious sushi! Â The best sushi I've found in Las Colinas. Â Katana 101 is my favorite along w the sizzling dumplings.
341,"Boyfriend and I had a little sushi date here at Little Katana and was so happy and delighted when we left. We sat at the sushi bar was graciously allowed to change the big screen to the game. We split and appetizer of the crispy calamari and honestly their batter is truly the best batter I would have never thought to pair great texture. Next we split the ANGEL roll which were a mouth full each bite, but were delightful and refreshing none the less. Of course we had to have a spicy type roll which so we continued with the SPICY SALMON ROLL and those pieces where so full and obviously made with love it was amazing. Then our last roll as my number one love and truly how I judge my sushi bars the SPIDER ROLL. Better than majority of the sushi bars right off the coast of California hands down. Ending our stay we enjoyed a bowl of miso and hot tea. So thankful y'all are around the corner, see you again soon!"
342,The food was probably some of the best I've had in a very long time. The Hot Stone Bowl with beef was absolutely amazing and very filling. The mango cheesecake was seriously the best cheesecake I've ever had and normally I don't like cheesecake. It wasn't super dense and tasted amazing. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice and proved for a great mood.
343,"Husband and I have very much been looking forward to the opening. Â We were finally able to go and the service, food, ambiance, etc. transcended our expectations. Â We struggled choosing what to order, as there were so many options that excited us. Â We will certainly be returning soon to try the other items. Â As for tonight, we had beer and wine, edamame, sushi rolls, and sashimi. Â I was a bit of a nuisance and asked to customize a roll. Â They did so without judgement and it was fantastic. Â I absolutely cannot wait to go back!"
344,"I came in with my wife on Valentines Friday due to the reputation of the Little Katana brand and having eaten at their other locations. We were promptly seated as the holiday weekend rush hadn't quite started and then promptly asked if we needed anything else... Then about 5 minutes later asked again if we were doing okay still without much ability to actually enjoy the restaurant or each other's company! This overbearing service continued throughout the meal, which almost seemed like a cover for the fact the food was far below what I expected from a Little Katana location and what I've actually gotten from other locations in the past. I understand this location is still getting its feet underneath themselves but there is much improvement required in my mind in order to live up to its named and inherited reputation."
345,I visited two nights ago. Everything tasted delicious until about an hour later when I started vomiting. I got food poisoning and I am pretty sure it was from the unagi.
346,I love every Little Katana in DFW. Â So loved that they were in Las Colinas. Â Never fails. Â Fresh and flavorful. Â Variety of choices and are happy to customize.
347,"We had one five star experience and one two star experience. Â The first was on a Saturday night with my husband and me. Â We enjoyed the live music, the half price bottles of wine, and actually thought the food was really great - one of the few places in Las Colinas we actually truly like! Â Second time our sweet and eager server was brand new and didn't seem to understand how to figure things out. Â He also neglected to tell us that it was half price bottle of wine night (on wednesday) - and I didn't see it on the chalkboard until we were done with our meal :(. Â Albacore jungle was mediocre, Kalbi was tough and sub par, and although they historically pan seared our gyoza vs. fried, they had a conflict about whether or not they could do it for us this time. Â The manager finally stepped in and went to the back to do it himself which was great, but did not completely make up for the other food issues. Â Brussel sprouts are always a hit :). Â We will definitely keep trying and will be back."
348,Absolutely a step up from the last place that was here. The food was amazing and the service was even more so. I can't wait to try happy hour!!!! Thank you for a wonderful meal!
349,"My first visit to this place was less than memorable. Â The walls are painted black, the table cloths are black. It is a very dismal and dim place. Â We were seated and waited nearly 10 minutes to get waited on, and the place wasn't that busy. Â  We also should have been asked if this was our first visit. We didn't know that we had to fill in a sheet on the table as to what we wanted to order. Â Our orders did Â not come out at the same time either. A bit too pricey for what little you get. It was not a good value for the price."
350,"Great food, perfect service. Will continue to come here as often as I can! Particularly love the hot stone bowl, the sizzling dumplings, and the agedashi tofu."
351,"Good service. Â Food is tasty and served in a timely manner. Â Some of the seafood a bit ""fishey "". Â Otherwise great place for dinner."
352,"I do not write reviews very often at all, but I have to for the experience I had at this really fine restaurant. I have been a weekly regular for the past several months, as it is located close to my residence. The staff is extremely friendly and service is spot on. I was in tonight on the 2nd of February, and had my usual, Sushi Roll/Happy Hour Shrimp Tempura, and a couple beers. After I asked for the check, I noticed the price for my Lobster Sushi roll was $20.00, and not the price on the menu which was $15.00. I will tell you, I normally never even look at my checks, as I trust the establishments I do business with. Well, as I noticed the difference on this check, I mentioned this to the nice waitress who I know. She went to the Manager (not Kenneth), and I noticed a tense conversation between the two at the bar area. Within a couple minutes, the waitress came back to me, and said the manager said the price was incorrect on the menu, and it was actually $20.00. I really did not know what to say, and nor did the nice waitress. I did not want to make a scene with her, so I paid the extra $5.00 bucks, but asked that he come to my table. I have had pleasant conversations with this manager in the past, so I was surprised to say the least. I obviously gave him my opinion about the practice of not honoring menu prices, and putting the nice waitress in the uncomfortable position of defending a Manager who definitely doesn't support his staff. As a regular of this establishment, I was shocked with the manager's decision process. I will definitely never go back to this establishment, or any establishment who does not honor pricing on their menu. I think he put this on his staff, for not telling me the price was not correct on the menu. Has he ever heard of printing updated menus. I feel terrible for the staff. They deserve better."
353,stopped in on a whim since i got the hot and new notification... sat at the bar.. asst mgr was behind the bar.. a lil pushy... wisely he knew i wasnt feelin him... he over some female attention... thats wats up... everything cool from there.. not as bomb as zennas but its in my hood
354,"Great sushi and friendly service. Â  We had the dragon roll, and the chef special which is sushi and sashimi. Â  Everything was very good."
355,"Great new addition to Las Colinas. Nice alternative to Blue Fish - more traditional. Had the Ahi Tower - its made with spicy tuna and was great. Dynamite sauce is really good and the shrimp tempura roll was awesome. Will definitely be back - interested to try the hibachi - no sitting with others and no show, my kind of hibachi."
356,"Great Sushi, Fast and friendly service, and great atmosphere! Â Will come back soon!!! Can't wait to try more on the menu. New place!"
357,"Arrived in Dallas for business and got off the plane very hungry. My friend was craving some ramen and found La Katana. After stepping inside, I was surprised a little. I had to take a second look at their Yelp page to see how many $s they had; only two. It looked like the restaurant could be pricier. A small bar was on the left as soon as you entered. All the tables were gathered in the center and a small piano towards the back right. The sushi bar was placed straight back, where we decided to sit. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, pushing fresh fish on their daily special menu. I caved and went with one of them. 2 pieces of sushi for $10. Pricey for me, but I splurged. The fish was very fresh. I also ordered the kimchi ramen. Extremely delicious! So much so, I even finished all the broth. I had ordered two rolls, but they were common rolls found at any sushi place. I used them as fillers just to get me full. If I visit Dallas again, I will be back. Thank you for the great service and food!"
358,"i really liked this place, everything we ordered was delicious. they made a little mistake with what we ordered but they were happy to replace it. the mamma roll and pappa roll were my favorite. the staff was friendly too. i am itching to go back."
